## Overall Thoughts

Gradio is a very easy way to get a Huggingface Space locally (via `load`), but also a way to build frontends for ML applications. 

Of note:
* When installing, make sure to create a virtual env
* Ensure to install Gradio in that env after activation
* Do not try to run your project in the `Gradio` repo by mistake :D
