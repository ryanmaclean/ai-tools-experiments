## Phase 1: Compare Live Site (ai-tools-lab.com) vs. Local (`test-branch`)

- [x] Start local development server.
- [x] Compare Homepage (visuals, structure, content).
- [x] Compare Transcript Page (ep01) (visuals, structure, content). Verified with enhanced episode-checker.js.
- [x] Compare Transcript Page (ep02) (visuals, structure, content). Verified with enhanced episode-checker.js.

- [x] Compare Transcript Page (ep16) (visuals, structure, content). Verified with enhanced episode-checker.js.
- [x] Compare Transcript Page (ep17) (visuals, structure, content). Verified with enhanced episode-checker.js. 
- [x] Compare Header & Footer (visuals, structure).
- [x] Compare Global Styles (styles.css).
- [x] Document discrepancies found.
    - Header: Local uses Header.astro with different structure, fewer nav links, different logo/hamburger menu elements. Live has bubble styles.
    - Footer: Local uses simpler footer (from MainLayout.astro?). Live has complex layout, logo, links, bubbles, gradient bg, different copyright.
    - CSS: Local styles.css missing bubble effects/animations present in live styles.css.
- [x] Identify discrepancies between local and live site footer/header (local simpler) - Updated Header.astro, Footer.astro, styles.css
- [x] Identify and fix missing thumbnail images (ep14, ep17) - Restored from Git history (commits 30b9c98, 8f0c7fa)
- [x] Synchronize episode URL slugs (local: /epNN -> /pages/epNN) to match live site. (Updated `[slug].astro` and links in `index.astro`)
- [x] Restore accidentally deleted pages (about, observations, resources) and assets (logos, favicon) during commit staging - Restored via `git checkout HEAD~1` and amended commit.
- [x] Visually verify local site (header, footer, thumbnails) matches live site using Puppeteer screenshots. (Adjusted Footer.astro content/structure to match live)
- [x] Visually verify local site (header, footer, thumbnails) matches live site using Puppeteer screenshots. (Note: Footer has minor content/structural diffs: links, Pi symbol, .site-footer class)

## Phase 1.5: Content Integration

- [x] Integrate HTML content from `src/content/transcripts/*.html` into the `src/pages/pages/[slug].astro` template. (Implemented via `import.meta.glob` and `set:html`)
- [x] Verify transcript content rendering on several episode pages (e.g., ep01, ep07, ep15).

## Phase 2: Cleanup & Organization (`test-branch`)

- [x] Identify and remove unused files/folders (e.g., old scrapers, redundant pages).
  - Checked root directory (removed CLAUDE.md, lighthouse reports)
  - Checked `src/pages` (all seem necessary)
- [x] Review `src/components` and `src/layouts` for unused components/layouts.
  - Header.astro & Footer.astro are used in MainLayout.astro.
  - Only MainLayout.astro exists in layouts.
- [x] Organize files/folders more intuitively (e.g., move `transcript_epNN.html` to a dedicated `content/transcripts` folder).
  - Verified transcripts are already in `src/content/transcripts`.

## Phase 2.5: Comprehensive Visual Verification (Local vs. Live)

- [x] Verify Homepage (`/`) matches `ai-tools-lab.com`. (Layout/styles match, content count may differ)
- [x] Verify About Page (`/pages/about`) matches `ai-tools-lab.com/pages/about`. (Using dynamic route + about.html)
- [x] Verify Resources Page (`/resources/`) matches `ai-tools-lab.com/resources`. (Layout/styles match, content may differ)
- [x] Verify Observations Page (`/observations/`) matches `ai-tools-lab.com/observations`. (Layout/styles match, content may differ)
- [x] Verify Transcript Pages (`/pages/epNN/`) match `ai-tools-lab.com/pages/epNN` (Checked ep01, ep07, ep15).

Note: The file `src/pages/about.astro` appears obsolete and doesn't match the live site's `/pages/about` structure. It should be reviewed/removed during cleanup.

## Phase 3: Final Review & Commit

- [x] Review all changes made.
- [x] Ensure site visually matches ai-tools-lab.com where intended.
- [x] Run final checks (linting, build).
- [x] Commit changes to `test` branch and push to ryanmaclean remote.
