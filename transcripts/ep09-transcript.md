[00:00:00] **Jason Hand:** Hey Jason.

[00:00:01] **Ryan MacLean:** Hey, how's it going?

[00:00:02] **Jason Hand:** Not too bad.

[00:00:03] **Jason Hand:** I wanna say it's been a minute, but yeah, I just saw you last week.

[00:00:06] **Ryan MacLean:** It's been like five minutes or something.

[00:00:10] **Jason Hand:** Actually a couple days.

[00:00:11] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, a little bit longer.

[00:00:12] **Ryan MacLean:** Not as long as it usually is.

[00:00:13] **Ryan MacLean:** Good to see you again.

[00:00:15] **Jason Hand:** For sure.

[00:00:15] **Jason Hand:** Where were we last week?

[00:00:16] **Jason Hand:** What were we doing again?

[00:00:17] **Jason Hand:** Remind me, we,

[00:00:18] **Ryan MacLean:** yeah, we went to San Jose, California for NVIDIA's GTC conference, the

[00:00:24] **Ryan MacLean:** Super Bowl of AI conferences, as they liked to, to say often last week.

[00:00:29] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, it was good.

[00:00:29] **Ryan MacLean:** We.

[00:00:31] **Jason Hand:** Go ahead.

[00:00:32] **Jason Hand:** It felt like the Super Bowl.

[00:00:33] **Jason Hand:** There were a lot of people there.

[00:00:34] **Jason Hand:** It was fairly busy.

[00:00:35] **Ryan MacLean:** I feel like I saw a different side of the conference that you did.

[00:00:38] **Ryan MacLean:** I was at the booth for four days.

[00:00:40] **Ryan MacLean:** Whereas I think you got to see some sessions, which

[00:00:41] **Ryan MacLean:** is pretty interesting, but.

[00:00:42] **Ryan MacLean:** It felt a lot bigger this year than last year, and a lot of the stories I heard of

[00:00:46] **Ryan MacLean:** were people, boots on the ground trying to actually get stuff running, some

[00:00:50] **Ryan MacLean:** experience, some dev stuff, some staging, a little bit of pride here and there.

[00:00:53] **Ryan MacLean:** But yeah, it sounds like people are actually trying to get some

[00:00:55] **Ryan MacLean:** work done now, which is awesome.

[00:00:58] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:00:58] **Jason Hand:** My, my take is same stuff.

[00:01:00] **Jason Hand:** It's gotten bigger, I think there's 25,000 plus people there this year.

[00:01:04] **Jason Hand:** They've expanded as you saw.

[00:01:06] **Jason Hand:** They've opened up.

[00:01:07] **Jason Hand:** Like the park in the middle of downtown San Jose and just blocked that all off.

[00:01:11] **Jason Hand:** And that's where we would go for lunch or just to get outside.

[00:01:14] **Jason Hand:** There was lines for all of the sessions, every session.

[00:01:17] **Jason Hand:** I went to 15 different sessions over the week and there was, I always

[00:01:22] **Jason Hand:** waited in a line of 30 minutes or more.

[00:01:24] **Jason Hand:** It was a lot and a lot of people.

[00:01:26] **Jason Hand:** And yeah, I needed the weekend to recover.

[00:01:29] **Jason Hand:** I'm not sure I fully have, but I do have a lot of notes from stuff

[00:01:32] **Jason Hand:** I need to go back and check out.

[00:01:33] **Jason Hand:** To your point, I think there's more people doing more now.

[00:01:36] **Jason Hand:** Last year, it seemed like a lot of looky-loos and just curious people

[00:01:40] **Jason Hand:** like, like me and just trying to understand what are people doing,

[00:01:42] **Jason Hand:** what are people experimenting with?

[00:01:44] **Jason Hand:** And now people are actually building some really interesting things.

[00:01:47] **Jason Hand:** The sessions I went to were all like high quality way, way much larger improvements

[00:01:55] **Jason Hand:** than I expected from last year.

[00:01:57] **Jason Hand:** There's a few dozens right from last year that I went to that

[00:01:59] **Jason Hand:** I was like, that was a waste.

[00:02:01] **Jason Hand:** And that didn't happen this year.

[00:02:03] **Ryan MacLean:** Oh, that's fantastic.

[00:02:04] **Jason Hand:** Yeah they were all really good.

[00:02:06] **Jason Hand:** I met with some really great people some contacts and some friends at

[00:02:09] **Jason Hand:** Nvidia that I only get to see there.

[00:02:12] **Jason Hand:** So overall, yeah, it was a great week.

[00:02:14] **Jason Hand:** We found, we, we went and had a good time at our favorite vegan vinyl restaurant.

[00:02:19] **Jason Hand:** Absolutely place.

[00:02:20] **Jason Hand:** And yeah, it's just a good good week of learning and soaking

[00:02:23] **Jason Hand:** things up and now I gotta.

[00:02:24] **Jason Hand:** Take my notes and try to do something interesting.

[00:02:27] **Jason Hand:** Just could just

[00:02:27] **Jason Hand:** coalesce all the knowledge together.

[00:02:29] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:02:29] **Jason Hand:** Now, one thing I did do is go around booths, looking around to see if

[00:02:32] **Jason Hand:** there's anything there to be seen.

[00:02:34] **Jason Hand:** There was, there were a lot of robots there, there were last year as well, but

[00:02:38] **Jason Hand:** there were a lot of mechanical arms to do surgeries remotely and stuff like that.

[00:02:42] **Jason Hand:** I think my favorite was that it was at the pebble flow, the the

[00:02:45] **Jason Hand:** electric trailer thing that we saw.

[00:02:47] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:02:48] **Jason Hand:** I don't know, maybe it's because I could get inside of something and look around that.

[00:02:50] **Jason Hand:** It was novel to me, but I thought that was pretty cool and I didn't expect to

[00:02:54] **Jason Hand:** see vehicles at an event like this, but there were definitely test drives as

[00:02:57] **Jason Hand:** well, which I thought was interesting.

[00:02:59] **Ryan MacLean:** That was very cool actually.

[00:03:00] **Ryan MacLean:** And I don't know if how this will work, but I'll, I'm switch

[00:03:03] **Ryan MacLean:** to my desktop real quick, just 'cause I have gtc Oh, website up.

[00:03:06] **Ryan MacLean:** But it's yeah, the, there was a lot of humanoid robots, just

[00:03:09] **Ryan MacLean:** a lot of robotics in general.

[00:03:11] **Ryan MacLean:** And autonomous vehicles.

[00:03:13] **Ryan MacLean:** There were more different autonomous vehicles this year.

[00:03:16] **Ryan MacLean:** And then to your point, the pebble which is this really

[00:03:19] **Ryan MacLean:** neat camping trailer that has.

[00:03:22] **Ryan MacLean:** It's a smart trailer essentially.

[00:03:24] **Ryan MacLean:** And not only is it, electric and you can live off the grid and got some

[00:03:28] **Ryan MacLean:** really cool features like that, but it'll also, it's got its own drive

[00:03:32] **Ryan MacLean:** train, so it'll help with the driving and cut back on, the fuel efficiency.

[00:03:36] **Ryan MacLean:** That it's, that something like that would be, sucking outta you.

[00:03:39] **Ryan MacLean:** So yeah, it was a really cool, I wish I had the money for

[00:03:42] **Ryan MacLean:** type of toy, but same thing.

[00:03:44] **Ryan MacLean:** I think it was

[00:03:44] **Ryan MacLean:** 170 5K was the one that we were looking at in US dollars.

[00:03:48] **Ryan MacLean:** It was like Canadian.

[00:03:48] **Ryan MacLean:** It's quite, it had that one feature though, that.

[00:03:52] **Jason Hand:** What was it called?

[00:03:53] **Jason Hand:** The smart hitch or magnetic hitch or something like that.

[00:03:55] **Ryan MacLean:** Magic tow Magic hit magic Tow Magic.

[00:03:57] **Ryan MacLean:** Could be magic hitch or something along those lines.

[00:03:58] **Ryan MacLean:** But yeah, it just it'll, using the app, you can drive it and

[00:04:02] **Ryan MacLean:** actually hitch onto your vehicle.

[00:04:04] **Ryan MacLean:** Amazing.

[00:04:04] **Ryan MacLean:** You can pivot it around so you can maneuver it into really tight spaces.

[00:04:08] **Ryan MacLean:** So yeah.

[00:04:09] **Ryan MacLean:** Different type of ai.

[00:04:10] **Ryan MacLean:** I am sure, somewhere in that thing in the app least.

[00:04:13] **Ryan MacLean:** But it was fun.

[00:04:14] **Ryan MacLean:** It was a really cool little trailer thing.

[00:04:16] **Jason Hand:** Definitely it

[00:04:17] **Jason Hand:** feels like the apply the application of Gen AI to some of these topics,

[00:04:21] **Jason Hand:** I think it's maybe when it's in the physical realm is obvious to me.

[00:04:23] **Jason Hand:** And I guess spending most of the day with, chat bots or ides or APIs, it's nice to

[00:04:28] **Jason Hand:** see some of this in the physical world.

[00:04:30] **Jason Hand:** I, it's scary as some of the, remote procedure robots and stuff

[00:04:33] **Jason Hand:** like that are, I think that is.

[00:04:35] **Ryan MacLean:** Future, and these are early days, so it can only get better

[00:04:37] **Ryan MacLean:** than where they are right now.

[00:04:38] **Ryan MacLean:** And I did see somebody manipulating little little elastic bands, for example, with

[00:04:42] **Ryan MacLean:** these tiny little oh yeah, manipulators, I guess they're called Surgical.

[00:04:46] **Ryan MacLean:** Surgical manipulators.

[00:04:47] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:04:47] **Ryan MacLean:** It was very interesting to see someone just off the street with a, like a VR

[00:04:52] **Ryan MacLean:** headset, just picking up a robotic arm and picking up this tiny little elastic band

[00:04:57] **Ryan MacLean:** in flexing, I thought was pretty cool.

[00:04:58] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, pretty impressive.

[00:05:00] **Ryan MacLean:** And good to know that.

[00:05:02] **Ryan MacLean:** You know that there's advancements like that, in medicine that are

[00:05:05] **Ryan MacLean:** beneficial from a lot of this stuff.

[00:05:07] **Ryan MacLean:** So I, I'm curious if there's any, you hung, you said you hung out at

[00:05:10] **Ryan MacLean:** the booth quite a bit more and this year and was there any themes, any

[00:05:15] **Ryan MacLean:** interesting conversations that came up at, at your time at the booth

[00:05:18] **Ryan MacLean:** that you wanted to share with us?

[00:05:20] **Jason Hand:** Obviously Datadog's got features and things like that.

[00:05:22] **Jason Hand:** So as I'm going through them, some things will resonate

[00:05:25] **Jason Hand:** with people more than others.

[00:05:27] **Jason Hand:** The main one that, that we were talking about was hallucination detection.

[00:05:30] **Jason Hand:** That seemed to strike a chord with a lot of people in terms of the

[00:05:32] **Jason Hand:** non-deterministic way that an API or a large language model may answer.

[00:05:37] **Jason Hand:** There were people asking about things like on-prem or air gap.

[00:05:41] **Jason Hand:** So I think security also seemed to be a little bit of concern, either in

[00:05:44] **Jason Hand:** the way that they're deploying things.

[00:05:46] **Jason Hand:** Or in terms of what they're adding to the models or perhaps their

[00:05:49] **Jason Hand:** clients may be using them for, there are only a few people talking

[00:05:52] **Jason Hand:** about what they're doing in prod.

[00:05:54] **Jason Hand:** A lot of them were a little bit hesitant in Devon staging in terms

[00:05:57] **Jason Hand:** of what they had not being confident to push that into prod just yet.

[00:06:01] **Jason Hand:** So they're in their experimental phase and they're worried I hate to use the word

[00:06:04] **Jason Hand:** governance 'cause it's not that exciting.

[00:06:06] **Jason Hand:** But in terms of on the backend, so you've deployed something,

[00:06:08] **Jason Hand:** it seems to be working, and then what would those failure modes.

[00:06:11] **Jason Hand:** B basically.

[00:06:12] **Jason Hand:** So it's a fear of the unknown, maybe a bit of uncertainty and doubt in terms of

[00:06:16] **Jason Hand:** what that would look like once it becomes in productionized, I hate to use this

[00:06:20] **Jason Hand:** term, but once it becomes the production feature, what are those things of concern?

[00:06:24] **Jason Hand:** One of them seems to be, I. Being able to make them deterministic,

[00:06:27] **Jason Hand:** either via caching or a database or reg or what have you.

[00:06:30] **Jason Hand:** The other is more around that security, so ensuring that there's no PII going into

[00:06:34] **Jason Hand:** this system 'cause they don't want it.

[00:06:36] **Jason Hand:** Two, that if it's being fine tuned that there's nothing coming out

[00:06:39] **Jason Hand:** of it that might be sensitive.

[00:06:40] **Jason Hand:** And then thirdly, just that security itself.

[00:06:42] **Jason Hand:** So it, there, there were only a couple people talking about wallet attacks.

[00:06:46] **Jason Hand:** So imagine you've got a competitor.

[00:06:47] **Jason Hand:** On your chat bot just, typing in stuff in order to hit your backend API.

[00:06:52] **Jason Hand:** So you get out a quota and then you have to downgrade your

[00:06:54] **Jason Hand:** service, that kind of thing.

[00:06:55] **Jason Hand:** But that came up as well as a bit of a concern is that a lot of these API calls

[00:07:00] **Jason Hand:** if in the cloud may cost money, and as a result, the question is how do I.

[00:07:04] **Jason Hand:** Stem or stop this flow basically of people coming in and maybe abusing my service

[00:07:08] **Jason Hand:** or overusing my service that they're overzealous and what does that look like?

[00:07:12] **Jason Hand:** How can I implement a quota system or find that one user and maybe slow down

[00:07:16] **Jason Hand:** the API request rate that they got.

[00:07:18] **Jason Hand:** But there were some interesting things that honestly, I hadn't thought of.

[00:07:21] **Jason Hand:** 'cause that one came up and I hadn't thought of the a, a wallet attack

[00:07:24] **Jason Hand:** kind of way, but it's more about rate limiting, at the end of the day.

[00:07:27] **Jason Hand:** But there were quite a few concerns about, not how do I get started,

[00:07:30] **Jason Hand:** but more like we, we have started, what do we need to know before

[00:07:33] **Jason Hand:** we go into production basically?

[00:07:35] **Jason Hand:** So again, I thought was fantastic.

[00:07:37] **Jason Hand:** I think if that's the state of maturity that we're at after one year, that tells

[00:07:40] **Jason Hand:** me that this is growing pretty fast.

[00:07:42] **Jason Hand:** And I guess it, it tells you and I that the rationale for having a

[00:07:45] **Jason Hand:** conversation like this is important because a lot of people are still

[00:07:48] **Jason Hand:** learning on a regular basis and it's growing by leaps and bounds.

[00:07:52] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:07:52] **Ryan MacLean:** Yep.

[00:07:53] **Ryan MacLean:** That was my experience too, and I know every time I came back by the

[00:07:55] **Ryan MacLean:** booth after, in between sessions there was always a huge crowd.

[00:07:59] **Ryan MacLean:** You were often there giving demos to like, usually one or two people and then two

[00:08:02] **Ryan MacLean:** people behind them were also kinda looking over their shoulder and then two people

[00:08:06] **Ryan MacLean:** were looking over their, it was trying

[00:08:07] **Ryan MacLean:** to project a bit.

[00:08:07] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:08:08] **Ryan MacLean:** And I even hung out there off oftentimes if I couldn't get into a

[00:08:12] **Ryan MacLean:** session, which happens because again, there's just so many people there.

[00:08:15] **Ryan MacLean:** So I would come back and I got into a lot of good conversations and

[00:08:18] **Ryan MacLean:** answering questions just 'cause there were so many people around.

[00:08:21] **Ryan MacLean:** And, we were crammed in between Crew AI and Fiddler, and then there was like 11

[00:08:25] **Ryan MacLean:** labs and there's a lot of like notable, companies in the space right around us.

[00:08:30] **Ryan MacLean:** And then you'll see somebody come up to us and it'll get, go one of two ways, either

[00:08:34] **Ryan MacLean:** no Datadog, and they're like, what are you doing over here with all these tools?

[00:08:37] **Ryan MacLean:** And what do you, and also what do you have to do about with ai?

[00:08:40] **Ryan MacLean:** Tell me more.

[00:08:41] **Ryan MacLean:** And then there's other people who, came up to me telling, saying that they.

[00:08:45] **Ryan MacLean:** We'd love to work with us whenever we're ready for a round of funding.

[00:08:49] **Ryan MacLean:** I just have no idea who we are and think we're over a small

[00:08:52] **Ryan MacLean:** company over here with the startup.

[00:08:54] **Ryan MacLean:** They thought we were series C or something yet.

[00:08:55] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:08:56] **Ryan MacLean:** Which was, it's fun.

[00:08:57] **Ryan MacLean:** You get a lot of, you get a lot of interesting people coming to the booth.

[00:09:00] **Jason Hand:** Definitely heard that and leading up to it.

[00:09:02] **Jason Hand:** I think you had actually done a bunch of work, so we didn't

[00:09:03] **Jason Hand:** have to do too much today.

[00:09:05] **Jason Hand:** What did it seems like you've been very busy.

[00:09:07] **Jason Hand:** Do you rest?

[00:09:10] **Ryan MacLean:** It's like working out, you sometimes you can't, it can't always be leg day.

[00:09:12] **Ryan MacLean:** You gotta have rest once in a while.

[00:09:14] **Jason Hand:** That's true.

[00:09:15] **Jason Hand:** That's true.

[00:09:15] **Ryan MacLean:** Lately my hours have dipped, but I think a lot of that's 'cause

[00:09:17] **Ryan MacLean:** it's, 'cause daylight saving has given us back more time and Right.

[00:09:21] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:09:21] **Ryan MacLean:** I'm just more productive this time of year.

[00:09:23] **Ryan MacLean:** But yeah, I did before we went on.

[00:09:25] **Ryan MacLean:** On our trip to out to San Jose for the conference I worked on a few things

[00:09:30] **Ryan MacLean:** because we knew we were gonna be gone.

[00:09:32] **Ryan MacLean:** We weren't trying to have an episode every week.

[00:09:33] **Ryan MacLean:** That's just a thing we're trying to stick with.

[00:09:35] **Ryan MacLean:** And I had some free time without, Ryan and I had, didn't have time to get

[00:09:38] **Ryan MacLean:** together a bunch, but I had been able to go and play with a few tools on my own.

[00:09:44] **Ryan MacLean:** Some things that we've already talked about Cursor, which

[00:09:46] **Ryan MacLean:** was one episode that, we did.

[00:09:48] **Ryan MacLean:** Couple weeks ago I've been playing around with Claude Code, which

[00:09:52] **Ryan MacLean:** is another right really fun tool.

[00:09:54] **Ryan MacLean:** And so I actually spent a lot of time using Claude code.

[00:09:58] **Ryan MacLean:** And I'm gonna switch over to my de desktop here.

[00:10:00] **Jason Hand:** Sure.

[00:10:01] **Ryan MacLean:** The

[00:10:02] **Ryan MacLean:** site looks way better.

[00:10:03] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:10:04] **Ryan MacLean:** So I used Claude code essentially to create a website for us.

[00:10:07] **Ryan MacLean:** So if you remember previously we had the.

[00:10:12] **Ryan MacLean:** The whole thing was on GitHub as far as what we're pointing people to, right?

[00:10:17] **Ryan MacLean:** Here inside the AI tools experiments.

[00:10:20] **Ryan MacLean:** This is just, whoops, runway.

[00:10:22] **Ryan MacLean:** This is where we were gonna have everything, right?

[00:10:23] **Ryan MacLean:** So I went ahead and I'm in the way here, but I went ahead and put in a link

[00:10:27] **Ryan MacLean:** that just takes you to where did it go?

[00:10:29] **Ryan MacLean:** Take Tuesday here now.

[00:10:30] **Ryan MacLean:** And essentially what I've done is created an episode for every.

[00:10:36] **Ryan MacLean:** Everything that we've done so far, and I think we were up to we went over automatic

[00:10:41] **Ryan MacLean:** 1111 a couple weeks ago with when you are showing us some stuff and then really

[00:10:46] **Ryan MacLean:** these next five I. The result of me some on the weekend, but some I did like in

[00:10:53] **Ryan MacLean:** Fri like last Thursday and Friday, and I was on a roll and I just kept hitting

[00:10:56] **Ryan MacLean:** and record with what I was doing.

[00:10:59] **Ryan MacLean:** And so if you go back and look I'll just explain briefly what these are.

[00:11:03] **Ryan MacLean:** This first one here is, you had Ryan suggested.

[00:11:08] **Ryan MacLean:** When we were doing the automatic 1111 that we add a feedback form of some right.

[00:11:12] **Ryan MacLean:** Of some type for every, everybody to like, just give us some feedback, give us some

[00:11:16] **Ryan MacLean:** suggestions on what you'd like to hear.

[00:11:18] **Ryan MacLean:** So that got me thinking like, how can I add a feedback form?

[00:11:22] **Ryan MacLean:** And I decided I, we, I need a website to put that feedback form on.

[00:11:26] **Ryan MacLean:** So what this video does is we'll take you and I've got it on YouTube.

[00:11:31] **Ryan MacLean:** It's unlisted.

[00:11:31] **Ryan MacLean:** But it'll take you to the video here.

[00:11:33] **Ryan MacLean:** If you click on the image and it'll.

[00:11:35] **Ryan MacLean:** Basically walk you through what I did to create this website.

[00:11:40] **Ryan MacLean:** And a lot of it's just HH TM L, JavaScript, CSS, nothing really

[00:11:44] **Ryan MacLean:** fancy going on, and my intention was to make it a GitHub page.

[00:11:50] **Ryan MacLean:** But the problem is, in order to do, down here at the very bottom

[00:11:53] **Ryan MacLean:** is the feedback form that I added.

[00:11:55] **Ryan MacLean:** And in order to do a feedback form, there's.

[00:11:57] **Ryan MacLean:** There's some, things you have to consider in terms of where it's hosted and

[00:12:01] **Ryan MacLean:** it's not exactly, I don't know if it's completely infeasible or unfeasible,

[00:12:06] **Ryan MacLean:** whatever the word is to do it.

[00:12:08] **Ryan MacLean:** But it's more difficult to set up a, for something that submits a.

[00:12:11] **Ryan MacLean:** Feedback from a GitHub page, right?

[00:12:13] **Ryan MacLean:** And I ran into those problems.

[00:12:15] **Ryan MacLean:** I expected I'd run into those problems, but I wanted to see

[00:12:17] **Ryan MacLean:** how Claude would handle it.

[00:12:19] **Ryan MacLean:** And so eventually we it suggested a pivot that we make this site a little

[00:12:24] **Ryan MacLean:** bit more advanced and we go ahead and deploy it onto Netlify with a proxy

[00:12:29] **Ryan MacLean:** server that can handle our cores.

[00:12:32] **Ryan MacLean:** Communication.

[00:12:33] **Ryan MacLean:** So sending, sending stuff, cross scripting stuff is basically what

[00:12:36] **Ryan MacLean:** it's trying to prevent you from doing.

[00:12:38] **Ryan MacLean:** And so it cloud code helped me write a little serverless function that I added

[00:12:43] **Ryan MacLean:** to my repo that has everything with the website, stuff that Claude also

[00:12:47] **Ryan MacLean:** helped, cloud Code helped me reach write.

[00:12:50] **Ryan MacLean:** And then I deployed it in net into Netlify after a little bit of back and

[00:12:54] **Ryan MacLean:** forth with a few minor errors in the in the build and deployment process.

[00:12:58] **Ryan MacLean:** We.

[00:12:59] **Ryan MacLean:** Finally got it working works great.

[00:13:01] **Ryan MacLean:** And the feedback form is, as you can see, it's nothing fancy.

[00:13:05] **Ryan MacLean:** In fact, okay, I need to add some more fields and make it

[00:13:07] **Ryan MacLean:** a little bit more helpful.

[00:13:08] **Ryan MacLean:** I just wanted it to be functional at this point, right?

[00:13:11] **Ryan MacLean:** But what I've got happening is you can put in your stuff here if I can remember my

[00:13:16] **Ryan MacLean:** email address and talk at the same time.

[00:13:20] **Ryan MacLean:** It's always video trying to type and talk.

[00:13:22] **Ryan MacLean:** Okay.

[00:13:22] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:13:23] **Ryan MacLean:** And so we're talking about cloud code here and I don't know, we'll say

[00:13:27] **Ryan MacLean:** something new and when I hit submit here you get, we get a little feedback

[00:13:33] **Ryan MacLean:** thing here from Chrome, but otherwise, you don't know what happened here.

[00:13:37] **Ryan MacLean:** What I did just for funsies, honestly, and to see if you could do it,

[00:13:41] **Ryan MacLean:** which is why I do a lot of things.

[00:13:43] **Ryan MacLean:** I had it sending that feedback, that form data over into Datadog.

[00:13:49] **Jason Hand:** Oh, gotcha.

[00:13:49] **Ryan MacLean:** So I can actually see it in, lemme see if I can pull up Datadog here.

[00:13:53] **Ryan MacLean:** But we can let's see.

[00:13:53] **Ryan MacLean:** Do I have, are you sending this

[00:13:54] **Ryan MacLean:** like a metric, like form created plus one or

[00:13:58] **Ryan MacLean:** just a a custom log, basically.

[00:14:01] **Jason Hand:** Oh, a log.

[00:14:02] **Jason Hand:** Okay.

[00:14:02] **Jason Hand:** Gotcha.

[00:14:02] **Jason Hand:** Yep.

[00:14:03] **Ryan MacLean:** And.

[00:14:07] **Ryan MacLean:** And then presumably going through, you could gr these logs or reject

[00:14:10] **Ryan MacLean:** them or something like that.

[00:14:11] **Jason Hand:** Yeah I haven't quite got to that because we're not getting any feedback in,

[00:14:14] **Jason Hand:** and I haven't just wanted to, I sorry.

[00:14:16] **Jason Hand:** Write some feedback on those one to one,

[00:14:19] **Jason Hand:** Pump on all that stuff here.

[00:14:21] **Jason Hand:** But yeah, ideally I'll be able to go in and start to see all that stuff.

[00:14:26] **Jason Hand:** And actually here, I'll switch to my screen now that I can show it.

[00:14:28] **Jason Hand:** So yeah, in Datadog here I can see the.

[00:14:32] **Jason Hand:** Like again, there's not

[00:14:33] **Jason Hand:** much coming over.

[00:14:34] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:14:34] **Jason Hand:** So can js on so we can parse it out.

[00:14:35] **Jason Hand:** That's pretty cool.

[00:14:36] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:14:36] **Jason Hand:** Add more fields in here, but then to your point, I think I could set up

[00:14:39] **Jason Hand:** some monitoring or some alerting or maybe even a workflow to have something

[00:14:45] **Jason Hand:** else happen, maybe to let me know that some feedback came in or Right.

[00:14:48] **Jason Hand:** To sign for a mailing

[00:14:49] **Jason Hand:** list or something.

[00:14:50] **Ryan MacLean:** Something dubious.

[00:14:51] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:14:52] **Jason Hand:** Oh yeah.

[00:14:52] **Jason Hand:** I dunno about that.

[00:14:53] **Jason Hand:** But but yeah, something along those lines, just to make it, it's a little

[00:14:57] **Jason Hand:** bit more interactive for me, so I don't just have to go into the dashboard and

[00:15:00] **Jason Hand:** look to see if we've got feedback right.

[00:15:02] **Jason Hand:** But that was, all just off your idea to add a feedback form.

[00:15:06] **Jason Hand:** Then I got to thinking I, I think I need a website, like a proper website, not

[00:15:10] **Jason Hand:** just a GitHub page, but I need a real website unless, this is the other thing.

[00:15:13] **Jason Hand:** I could have just done a Google form or of course, there's a million other

[00:15:16] **Jason Hand:** form deployments out there, but like that, where's the fun in that, and I'm

[00:15:19] **Jason Hand:** always looking for some ways to like.

[00:15:21] **Jason Hand:** Do something weird with Datadog, just like abuse the platform in fun ways.

[00:15:26] **Jason Hand:** Maybe abuse is not the right word, but use it in ways.

[00:15:28] **Jason Hand:** Leverage, it wasn't intended to be a form submission tool.

[00:15:32] **Jason Hand:** Novel

[00:15:32] **Jason Hand:** usage.

[00:15:33] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, for sure.

[00:15:33] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah,

[00:15:34] **Ryan MacLean:** exactly.

[00:15:34] **Ryan MacLean:** Novels may be better, but yeah, so did that.

[00:15:37] **Ryan MacLean:** And then that was that first episode that I recorded and in the next

[00:15:43] **Ryan MacLean:** ones I basically went through.

[00:15:45] **Ryan MacLean:** All of the projects that I've worked on.

[00:15:47] **Ryan MacLean:** If I go back into my into my GitHub, a lot of these projects that I have down

[00:15:52] **Ryan MacLean:** here for example, the vinyl viewer one.

[00:15:56] **Ryan MacLean:** Which is just a way for me to view my vinyl record collection.

[00:15:59] **Ryan MacLean:** As well as the Ignite Karaoke one, which is one I built for the team.

[00:16:03] **Ryan MacLean:** And then decided to just make out, put out there.

[00:16:06] **Ryan MacLean:** And then this last one here, this it's pronounced.

[00:16:09] **Ryan MacLean:** A little weird but yes, he tell you a call of

[00:16:12] **Ryan MacLean:** cats.

[00:16:12] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, it's hard.

[00:16:14] **Jason Hand:** Exactly.

[00:16:15] **Jason Hand:** And especially if you can't see my mouth.

[00:16:16] **Jason Hand:** But anyway I think everybody who owns a cat knows what it says.

[00:16:19] **Jason Hand:** So that's another project that I decided to go back and see if I could improve

[00:16:24] **Jason Hand:** upon all of those to some degree.

[00:16:26] **Jason Hand:** And like under an hour, 40 minutes or so.

[00:16:29] **Jason Hand:** And so I went and did that.

[00:16:31] **Jason Hand:** And I wanna show you a few of the things, of course that, that I did.

[00:16:35] **Jason Hand:** So back on my desktop here in, in my website, first of all, I like

[00:16:38] **Jason Hand:** updated my website also the same way, one of one of those videos.

[00:16:41] **Jason Hand:** Thank you.

[00:16:42] **Jason Hand:** One of those videos helped me do some cleanup here, including just talking

[00:16:45] **Jason Hand:** to cla Claude saying, Hey, I wanna add a bunch of new links up at the top.

[00:16:48] **Jason Hand:** And it just helped me, get through that in much faster.

[00:16:51] **Jason Hand:** Let me go through the ones that, that I just mentioned off so that Ignite karaoke.

[00:16:55] **Jason Hand:** One, I don't know, Ryan, if you remember this tool.

[00:16:57] **Ryan MacLean:** I sure do.

[00:16:58] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:16:58] **Jason Hand:** But the, this tool lets you play Ignite Karaoke with, whoever your team, your

[00:17:05] **Jason Hand:** friends, and forever when I first made it up here at the very top, this is

[00:17:10] **Jason Hand:** supposed to be like a fire flame here.

[00:17:11] **Jason Hand:** Best you can do in CSS.

[00:17:13] **Jason Hand:** But there was this huge gap up there and it bugged me and I couldn't

[00:17:17] **Jason Hand:** figure out how to get rid of it.

[00:17:18] **Jason Hand:** So I decided to ask Claude code to try to help me.

[00:17:21] **Jason Hand:** Sort that out.

[00:17:22] **Jason Hand:** And like within five minutes I had this thing finally like bug

[00:17:27] **Jason Hand:** free in terms of the things up there that were bothering me.

[00:17:30] **Jason Hand:** So that was a real quick win that I've been sitting on this for a year, I think,

[00:17:35] **Jason Hand:** or something like that is the last time I went in here and tried to solve for that.

[00:17:38] **Jason Hand:** So anyway, it was fun to just go in and I'm stalling here to let

[00:17:41] **Jason Hand:** all these images go by of course.

[00:17:43] **Jason Hand:** But it was fun to go through and revisit this project 'cause I feel, and then put

[00:17:47] **Jason Hand:** it back on my website because I feel like now it is a little bit more complete.

[00:17:50] **Jason Hand:** I've got some ideas on other things I wanna do but maybe it is, something that

[00:17:54] **Jason Hand:** some other teams would like to play with.

[00:17:57] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, definitely.

[00:17:57] **Ryan MacLean:** I think this exercise would really cool.

[00:17:59] **Ryan MacLean:** I stumbled a little bit 'cause it's not something I'm used to, but I

[00:18:01] **Ryan MacLean:** think it just, I. One that, that, the concept was new to me, but two,

[00:18:05] **Ryan MacLean:** being able to have a website where you stand it up really easily to do

[00:18:08] **Ryan MacLean:** it where it's already done for you and you can modify from it if you want to.

[00:18:12] **Ryan MacLean:** I think it's really cool for other teams to try this experiment and

[00:18:15] **Ryan MacLean:** see how it might work for the teams.

[00:18:16] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, it was neat.

[00:18:17] **Jason Hand:** I like to code, but I don't always want to code.

[00:18:20] **Jason Hand:** Sometimes I just wanna solve a problem, sometimes I'm doing it for

[00:18:23] **Jason Hand:** I, I enjoy the process but other times I just wanna get to the.

[00:18:27] **Jason Hand:** The thing that I'm building, like kinda I feel like I'm allow, I am,

[00:18:31] **Jason Hand:** I'm able to swing in and out of those two modes a lot easier than I Gotcha.

[00:18:35] **Jason Hand:** Maybe previous had.

[00:18:36] **Jason Hand:** So I think that's cool.

[00:18:37] **Jason Hand:** So that's the Ignite Karaoke, the vinyl viewers.

[00:18:40] **Jason Hand:** Another one that I liked or I was able to figure out a solution to this one.

[00:18:44] **Jason Hand:** I don't know if I've showed you this before, Ryan, but these are these are all

[00:18:47] **Jason Hand:** the records that I have in my collection, and you can come in and, click on one.

[00:18:52] **Jason Hand:** I need to zoom out just a little bit and listen to, I won't play it 'cause

[00:18:57] **Jason Hand:** it'll just get blocked on YouTube anyway.

[00:18:58] **Jason Hand:** But you can play, a little snippet of the record.

[00:19:00] **Jason Hand:** Pick another one.

[00:19:01] **Jason Hand:** And, and eventually I was gonna have in what this market rates are for

[00:19:04] **Jason Hand:** each one, because trying to keep track of the value of everything.

[00:19:07] **Jason Hand:** But anyway, fun little tool here.

[00:19:09] **Jason Hand:** I use it because I can come in here and, I've got a ton of Frank Zappa of course.

[00:19:14] **Jason Hand:** And so if I type in Zappa, I can see all the ones that I have.

[00:19:17] **Jason Hand:** Previously when, you type in Zappa in the search bar, it came up.

[00:19:22] **Jason Hand:** Everything right?

[00:19:23] **Jason Hand:** It like filtered all of them correctly.

[00:19:24] **Jason Hand:** But then if you just, if you clicked on one like Zoo Lus, right?

[00:19:29] **Jason Hand:** It would show you like some other record.

[00:19:32] **Jason Hand:** It would just pull up like the, the front art and everything from

[00:19:35] **Jason Hand:** like a, for different, completely different artists, all that.

[00:19:37] **Ryan MacLean:** Gotcha.

[00:19:37] **Jason Hand:** So it wasn't matching up what was going on.

[00:19:41] **Jason Hand:** And so I gave the code base, the Claude code, and I explained what's happening and

[00:19:46] **Jason Hand:** within 20 minutes we had it sorted out.

[00:19:49] **Ryan MacLean:** Very cool.

[00:19:49] **Jason Hand:** And then I went in and made some other little adjustments and improvements to it.

[00:19:52] **Jason Hand:** So finally got that working, which is really nice.

[00:19:55] **Jason Hand:** And then the other one that I think actually is turning out really

[00:20:00] **Jason Hand:** fun or really good  as they say.

[00:20:02] **Jason Hand:** And this one, if you look I, you can still see here.

[00:20:06] **Jason Hand:** This was the original interface right, that I had, which is

[00:20:10] **Jason Hand:** fine.

[00:20:11] **Jason Hand:** It looks like something I would build.

[00:20:12] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:20:13] **Jason Hand:** I, no offense, don't plan, no offense.

[00:20:15] **Ryan MacLean:** It's functional.

[00:20:16] **Jason Hand:** It works, it's all I know.

[00:20:18] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:20:18] **Ryan MacLean:** But there's room for improvement and so that's where we're at now.

[00:20:22] **Ryan MacLean:** And so I can come in here and I can put in, I can ask

[00:20:26] **Ryan MacLean:** though what's the key word that you're using to make this better?

[00:20:28] **Jason Hand:** Make not ugly?

[00:20:29] **Jason Hand:** What is the thing that helps you get cloud code to make this look better?

[00:20:32] **Ryan MacLean:** That's a good question.

[00:20:33] **Ryan MacLean:** What I did was, obviously I gave it my code base and said I

[00:20:37] **Ryan MacLean:** wanna improve, certain things.

[00:20:38] **Ryan MacLean:** But I did get specific on here's the colors that I like, I like to

[00:20:42] **Ryan MacLean:** use like the Datadog color palette.

[00:20:44] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:20:45] **Jason Hand:** I said I want to use some shadowing and really just gave it some

[00:20:47] **Jason Hand:** direction on like the CSSI wanna make sure that it works well on mobile.

[00:20:51] **Ryan MacLean:** Gotcha.

[00:20:52] **Jason Hand:** And it was a pretty irr it was more of an iterative process with

[00:20:55] **Jason Hand:** this one to go back and forth.

[00:20:57] **Jason Hand:** You can see here anything that doesn't have any animal, that doesn't have a, like

[00:21:01] **Jason Hand:** a placeholder just automatically shows the Datadog one, which I think I must.

[00:21:04] **Jason Hand:** Change to, to something else.

[00:21:06] **Jason Hand:** But but yeah, you can come in here and choose, I'm possibly in the

[00:21:09] **Jason Hand:** market for adopting a new cat.

[00:21:11] **Jason Hand:** And we can come in here and take a look at day while these cats are

[00:21:14] **Jason Hand:** adorable and,

[00:21:16] **Ryan MacLean:** This is a dangerous application.

[00:21:17] **Ryan MacLean:** I kept adopting a cat for sure.

[00:21:19] **Jason Hand:** Originally I was trying to decide if there's some way to use ai.

[00:21:23] **Jason Hand:** In these images to help them find a home a little bit faster, like all those animals,

[00:21:28] **Jason Hand:** those pets don't have an image at all.

[00:21:30] **Jason Hand:** It, they don't really have that good of a chance of finding a

[00:21:33] **Jason Hand:** home, until there's an image.

[00:21:34] **Jason Hand:** I put the Datadog one up, but what could we do with AI to find a pet,

[00:21:38] **Jason Hand:** put something else that like draws people in to at least go look.

[00:21:41] **Jason Hand:** Oh, that, that animal is at the shelter.

[00:21:44] **Jason Hand:** That's 10 minutes from me.

[00:21:45] **Jason Hand:** Just make it a little easier to get these pets adopted.

[00:21:48] **Jason Hand:** And then I'm obviously building it for myself 'cause I'm,

[00:21:51] **Jason Hand:** looking for another one too.

[00:21:53] **Jason Hand:** And this is exactly how I found watermelon.

[00:21:55] **Jason Hand:** If you've met my current cat watermelon.

[00:21:57] **Jason Hand:** I built this app last year around this time.

[00:22:00] **Jason Hand:** And even though it was ugly, it helped me, it led me to her.

[00:22:04] **Jason Hand:** And so we're going through v two of that process again.

[00:22:07] **Ryan MacLean:** That's really cool.

[00:22:08] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, so anyway, that that's pretty much it.

[00:22:11] **Jason Hand:** If you go and check out the site here.

[00:22:13] **Jason Hand:** I'll pull it up one more time.

[00:22:15] **Jason Hand:** Oops, wrong one.

[00:22:16] **Jason Hand:** The other few things down here is just more of the TSS one is more of

[00:22:22] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, fix, fixing the Ignite Karaoke this is going through and changing

[00:22:27] **Jason Hand:** and fixing things in with my website.

[00:22:29] **Jason Hand:** So they're all about 30, 40 minutes.

[00:22:31] **Jason Hand:** And just like a lot of the stuff we've been doing, just walks you through

[00:22:35] **Jason Hand:** exactly what we see and what we're experiencing, kinda learning in public.

[00:22:39] **Ryan MacLean:** Exactly.

[00:22:39] **Jason Hand:** And just sharing that with you.

[00:22:41] **Jason Hand:** There's very few edits I've cut out, some filler words here and there just

[00:22:45] **Jason Hand:** to compress the time a little bit.

[00:22:47] **Jason Hand:** But I've tried to keep it pretty raw and show you exactly

[00:22:50] **Jason Hand:** what's happening and yeah.

[00:22:52] **Jason Hand:** Keep doing it that way until we hear otherwise.

[00:22:54] **Ryan MacLean:** So that's, that is awesome.

[00:22:55] **Ryan MacLean:** I feel like I gotta do the

[00:22:57] **Ryan MacLean:** go, do the same.

[00:22:57] **Ryan MacLean:** Gotta get off my get off my rocker here and start doing some work.

[00:23:02] **Jason Hand:** Speaking of the next thing I know you've already been on your horse, on your

[00:23:06] **Jason Hand:** rock outta your rocker bit, little bit.

[00:23:08] **Jason Hand:** So what is it you're gonna, maybe share with us like, probably not enough

[00:23:11] **Jason Hand:** time today, but maybe the next week we

[00:23:14] **Jason Hand:** can.

[00:23:14] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah, I think so.

[00:23:15] **Ryan MacLean:** Last time we talked a little bit about stable diffusion, so I'd like to talk

[00:23:17] **Ryan MacLean:** about the future of what that looks like in terms of image generation or at least.

[00:23:22] **Ryan MacLean:** To text as we as well.

[00:23:23] **Ryan MacLean:** So going the other way flex one or Flex one dev is what I'd like

[00:23:27] **Ryan MacLean:** to demo, but I think next week I'll probably talk about Windsurf.

[00:23:30] **Ryan MacLean:** I will say I went to the booth at GTC.

[00:23:33] **Ryan MacLean:** I have also used it a little bit, but only used it in a way that it would be like

[00:23:36] **Ryan MacLean:** I imagining you know, how to use an id.

[00:23:38] **Ryan MacLean:** So I was using the way that you'd use Cursor.

[00:23:40] **Ryan MacLean:** Winder actually has a whole bunch of features that I've not.

[00:23:43] **Ryan MacLean:** Touched at all.

[00:23:43] **Ryan MacLean:** I've essentially just used that as in another IDEI think I'd like

[00:23:47] **Ryan MacLean:** to talk a little bit about how it works and how it might be a

[00:23:49] **Ryan MacLean:** little bit different than cursor.

[00:23:51] **Ryan MacLean:** Not better or worse, just a little bit different.

[00:23:53] **Ryan MacLean:** I'll try to wear the t-shirt that I got I thought was pretty funny

[00:23:56] **Ryan MacLean:** and they also gave me those like the sleep mask kind of thing.

[00:23:59] **Jason Hand:** Oh yeah.

[00:23:59] **Ryan MacLean:** But yeah, I def I've got all the, so it behooves me to

[00:24:02] **Ryan MacLean:** talk about their, the topic.

[00:24:03] **Ryan MacLean:** But I do feel like at this point in time we've reached a point where

[00:24:06] **Ryan MacLean:** there are a couple IDs that are.

[00:24:08] **Ryan MacLean:** Popular so you get cursor and windsurf.

[00:24:10] **Ryan MacLean:** There's a few more that are becoming in vogue again.

[00:24:13] **Ryan MacLean:** So I think Inte is also trying to add similar features to theirs and you can see

[00:24:17] **Ryan MacLean:** VS code as well, trying to figure out what that looks like on their end with copilot

[00:24:21] **Ryan MacLean:** so I can change copilot to look at it.

[00:24:23] **Ryan MacLean:** What I'd like to eventually do is like circle back and look at BS code and maybe

[00:24:27] **Ryan MacLean:** Intel j be it Idea or what have you.

[00:24:30] **Ryan MacLean:** But at this point in time, I think the next one I'd like to look at is

[00:24:32] **Ryan MacLean:** Windsurf and talk about how things are maybe similar but not the same

[00:24:35] **Ryan MacLean:** as Cursor, and then go from there.

[00:24:38] **Jason Hand:** Excellent.

[00:24:39] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, I've I've been wanting to get my hands on Windsurf and it'll

[00:24:43] **Jason Hand:** be fun to kinda get your take on it and see what you'll do with it.

[00:24:45] **Jason Hand:** So looking forward to that.

[00:24:48] **Ryan MacLean:** And, lots of things.

[00:24:50] **Ryan MacLean:** You just reminded me too.

[00:24:51] **Ryan MacLean:** There's even though we've played with Google's suite of tools and Right.

[00:24:55] **Ryan MacLean:** Gemini and Gemma and all that.

[00:24:56] **Jason Hand:** Gemini and Gemma and all that.

[00:24:57] **Ryan MacLean:** I need to add some stuff in there because one of the sessions I went to at GTC

[00:25:01] **Ryan MacLean:** was a former coworker of mine and she was showing off doing some stuff in a

[00:25:06] **Ryan MacLean:** Google notebook, Google collab notebook.

[00:25:09] **Ryan MacLean:** With Jim or Gemini.

[00:25:10] **Ryan MacLean:** I'm not sure which model she might have been using, but Right.

[00:25:12] **Ryan MacLean:** With the interface in there.

[00:25:14] **Ryan MacLean:** And that gave me a ton of ideas too.

[00:25:16] **Ryan MacLean:** So I, yeah I already had too many toys to go play with and now it's tripled since,

[00:25:21] **Ryan MacLean:** got more, yeah.

[00:25:22] **Jason Hand:** I also got an email last week while we were at the conference set

[00:25:25] **Jason Hand:** as part of my Google enterprise.

[00:25:27] **Jason Hand:** I think I get.

[00:25:28] **Jason Hand:** Notebook, LM Plus is part of that subscription.

[00:25:30] **Jason Hand:** So I'd like to kick the tires with that as well at some point.

[00:25:32] **Jason Hand:** But but yeah, something along those lines, just to make it, it's a little

[00:25:33] **Jason Hand:** bit more interactive for me, so I don't just have to go into the dashboard and

[00:25:36] **Jason Hand:** Yeah, because you're right.

[00:25:37] **Jason Hand:** What feels like a quote unquote ID to us may be different for something like

[00:25:40] **Jason Hand:** a, somebody, like a data scientist or somebody who's working with more

[00:25:42] **Jason Hand:** models on a regular basis, Python.

[00:25:44] **Jason Hand:** Python specific kind of viewpoint might be to start with a notebook

[00:25:46] **Jason Hand:** and go from there to something else.

[00:25:48] **Ryan MacLean:** That's right.

[00:25:48] **Ryan MacLean:** We can open up, Python notebooks, Jupyter Notebooks, some kind

[00:25:51] **Ryan MacLean:** of notebook in lots of ways.

[00:25:52] **Ryan MacLean:** But the Google collab thing is its own unique thing, right?

[00:25:56] **Jason Hand:** Yeah.

[00:25:57] **Jason Hand:** I did a web I did a webinar on it, but that was over a year ago and

[00:26:01] **Jason Hand:** so much has changed since then.

[00:26:03] **Jason Hand:** So it's changed a ton.

[00:26:04] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:26:04] **Ryan MacLean:** Just need to come back and play with it.

[00:26:06] **Jason Hand:** Absolutely.

[00:26:06] **Ryan MacLean:** I lost chance.

[00:26:07] **Ryan MacLean:** Here're data science.

[00:26:07] **Ryan MacLean:** They don't they, that is like the, their IDE basically.

[00:26:11] **Ryan MacLean:** And it works.

[00:26:13] **Ryan MacLean:** Great for lots of other reasons too.

[00:26:14] **Ryan MacLean:** I can think of a hundred ways to like do some interesting things in a notebook

[00:26:17] **Ryan MacLean:** that, you're just running little snippets of code that absolutely stitch together.

[00:26:21] **Ryan MacLean:** It's a really

[00:26:21] **Ryan MacLean:** good teaching tool at the very least.

[00:26:23] **Ryan MacLean:** Yeah.

[00:26:23] **Ryan MacLean:** I find being able to show people stepping through this is what, this is how

[00:26:26] **Ryan MacLean:** you install the Datadog integration, here's the next step kind of thing.

[00:26:29] **Ryan MacLean:** It's actually pretty handy for that.

[00:26:30] **Ryan MacLean:** It's

[00:26:30] **Ryan MacLean:** very good for that.

[00:26:31] **Ryan MacLean:** So we should re revisit that too.

[00:26:34] **Jason Hand:** Definitely.

[00:26:35] **Jason Hand:** Alright for the sake of time, we should probably wrap this one up and let's do.

[00:26:39] **Jason Hand:** We will be back again next week with some stuff about windsurf, it sounds and maybe

[00:26:44] **Jason Hand:** some other things too, depending on time.

[00:26:45] **Jason Hand:** So looking forward to that.

[00:26:47] **Ryan MacLean:** Absolutely.

[00:26:48] **Ryan MacLean:** Thank you so much for the recap and your point of view from GTC.

[00:26:51] **Ryan MacLean:** 'cause we definitely had two completely different conference

[00:26:54] **Ryan MacLean:** experience, aside from listening to records with our friend Bob.

[00:26:56] **Ryan MacLean:** But yes, that was a fantastic conference.

[00:26:58] **Ryan MacLean:** That's

[00:26:59] **Jason Hand:** true.

[00:26:59] **Jason Hand:** And I will, once I get time, and I mean we're recording this on Monday

[00:27:02] **Jason Hand:** and we just got home this weekend.

[00:27:04] **Jason Hand:** As soon as I get time to go through my notes, I will summarize them in

[00:27:07] **Jason Hand:** some fashion and post them in the show notes of this very cool recording.

[00:27:11] **Jason Hand:** Very just so that in case anybody's curious about those sessions that

[00:27:14] **Jason Hand:** I attended, they're really good.

[00:27:15] **Jason Hand:** That's all I got and we'll see you next time.

[00:27:18] **Ryan MacLean:** Alright folks.

[00:27:18] **Ryan MacLean:** Have a great week.

[00:27:20] **Ryan MacLean:** Bye bye.
