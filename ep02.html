            <h1>Episode Notes: Warp Terminal & Cursor</h1>
            
            <h2>Episode Summary</h2>

            <p>This session focused on exploring Warp Terminal and Cursor - two AI-enhanced developer tools.</p>
            
            <p>Jason Hand demonstrates a project he built using Warp Terminal with the Claude Sonnet 3.7 model. The project is a simple web application that streams logs and metrics to Datadog. Jason explains how Warp Terminal's AI assistant helped him create this application, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the tool.</p>
            
            <p>In the second half, Jason and Ryan explore Cursor, an AI-enhanced code editor based on VS Code. They use Cursor to review and improve the accessibility of the application created with Warp Terminal. The discussion covers Cursor's interface, its different AI interaction modes, and how it compares to Warp Terminal.</p>
            
            <p>Key points covered include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Warp Terminal's interface and AI integration</li>

            <h3>Video Summary</h3>
            <p>In this video, Jason demonstrates using Claude Code to update his personal website without writing any code. He starts by identifying several changes he wants to make to his site, including removing a section, updating menu options, and adding new content. He creates a to-do list of 11 items and submits it directly to Claude Code. Without requiring much intervention, Claude successfully implements most of the requested changes, including removing menu items, adding new project pages, and updating links. Throughout the process, Claude Code demonstrates its ability to understand context and implement complex changes to the website with minimal direction, proving to be an efficient tool for website maintenance.</p>

            <h3>Video Summary</h3>
            <p>In this video, Jason revisits a project called "Vinyl Viewer" that he created 10 months ago to display his record collection. He identifies a long-standing bug where searching for records works correctly, but clicking on search results displays the wrong record details. Using Cursor with Claude Sonnet 3.7, Jason thoroughly explains the issue without suggesting a solution. Claude quickly identifies the problem - the app creates a filtered data array during search, but when users click on a record, it incorrectly references the original unfiltered data array. Claude implements a fix by modifying the code to reference the correct data source based on whether a search is active. After implementing Claude's solution, Jason tests the app and confirms the bug has been successfully fixed, allowing him to properly view details for his Frank Zappa records and other artists.</p>

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> So listen, I spent my weekend trying to stay away from AI generated stuff. I don't know why, I just stayed off the computer.

But it sounds like you've been digging into some stuff. What have you been up to?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:11]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah I didn't spend all weekend on the computer, but I did spend a chunk of range of time on Friday Yeah, I was too nice outside to do that. Mmm. I played golf actually. Oh, there you go I used to get outside enjoy the weather but on Friday before I was done, you know with the day working I spent a fair amount of time playing with this new tool that I had learned about called warp.

It's not actually new. It's been around for a while on Linux and Mac, but they just released it on windows and it's a terminal like shell complete package type of thing, but does a whole bunch of other stuff too. That kind of modernizes it a little bit, but also keeps it in the command line interface feeling, slash terminals, feeling vibe, [00:01:00] explaining it, it just doesn't get it.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:02]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> You almost need to show it.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:03]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah. Yeah, you got it. You definitely have to, I would say, I'm going to show it for sure, but I think everybody should go play with it.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:08]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> It's like, how much better can this be than PuTTY or what have you, you know what I mean?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:13]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> But, you may be thinking what does that have to do with AI? We're already getting off track. So it has an AI agent built into it. Cursor is what we were going to talk about today.

And I wanted to have an app ready to go to see if cursor can help me with that. But then I learned about warp and I got sidetracked as I do. Sonnet 3. 7 also just recently came out. From Claude, right? From Claude and also a companion app called Code, Claude Code, which is also a terminal, it's more of a Python thing, package, or I don't know if you called a library.

there's been a bunch of other things I wanted to play with, but long story short, I went ahead and spent some time with terminal going through just the free tier to see how many like tokens it would let me play with and just see what it was doing.

I recorded the whole process. So I thought we could step through that before we get into [00:02:00] cursor because honestly, warp was really fun. I'm looking forward to playing with it more, using it more, not just playing with it, but it seems very useful. So let me pull up a video of that first here, and then we can go through that together.

Okay, so if you want to share my screen here. Anyway, once you get Warp installed, if you're familiar with the Windows Terminal, if you've ever used that, it's going to feel very similar to that. And so you can go back and forth between natural conversations or just like typing in commands. If you ask Claude what to do, it'll tell you what command to run and it'll even pre populate it for you. So it gives you, a little bit of heads up on stuff.

I didn't really want to go that route first when I started playing with this. I wanted to dive right in with what can Cloud 3. 0, or sorry, 3. 7 Sonnet build for me using this. And previously, I'd already been thinking about some ideas around just a very basic demo that can send some logs and metrics to Datadog.

That we can visually see [00:03:00] on a dashboard in Datadog. Just to show you how basically how easy it is to, instrument something. And so that's what I aimed to do here Warp. And I put that in there and, I'm not going to go through all, whatever this is, hour long video.

We don't have time for that. But you can see that after it thought through what it needed to do. Is this a reasoning model? I believe it is a reasoning model. Where it gives you what it thinks it needs to do. And then if it's a command that you need to run in the terminal, it comes up like this and then gives you the option to hit enter or click on it to run it. And then it just throws that into the terminal and then executes it for you. Very cool.

And so you just go through that process, especially when you're in, a new environment like I am, I'm on this new Windows machine here. And so nothing's really set up at all. it goes through and decides what needs to be done, creating different directories, based on what I asked it.

And here you can see me just experimenting with the interface a little bit to see one of the really cool things about warp is the share block feature.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:03:59]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, it [00:04:00] wasn't necessarily the strong suit. Yeah, I would agree.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:02]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> So now you can actually like copy. What and paste it just like it is somebody else or share it with somebody else. I should say. It's not necessarily exactly right,

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:12]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> but I'll grab all that white space. So it's not all jumble when you go to paste it.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:16]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Exactly. Yeah. So that's like one of those things of.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:18]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Indeed. Why does a new terminal need to make this obvious? That's hilarious.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:22]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay, so over here on the right now, you can see where it's starting to create some code for me.

It's creating this index file. And before it actually creates anything, it always gives you this diff. thing or, if it's just new code, it's all green here like this You just hit apply changes or hit enter and it starts creating that file.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:40]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Where did it get the code color 632? C A 6, because I know that code color, but not everyone's going to be aware of why that's important.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:50]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> For those of you who don't know, that's the Datadog purple.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:52]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Exactly, thank you.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:54]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> And yes, so that's why it's actually done quite well there. Gotcha. So let's [00:05:00] fast forward here a little bit. I think eventually I pull over. Look at that. So here's the file, the index file that it created initially. There we go. Pull up the app. Now what I was trying to get it to do, if you read the text, or the prompt, is I wanted to just drop my own JSON file in there that sort of Right.

Represents a log or a metric, and then put in my own API key because that way it's easier for everybody to just drop their own key in and play with this, that turned out to be not a great implementation or I guess approach to doing all this. To full transparency, I went down this route for a long time for the rest of this video.

But then last night, I came back and decided to take another stab at it, but I went ahead and signed up for Warp, to unlock some more tokens. I'm not paying for anything.

Yeah, it's just that I signed up. And that's all I did. And so far, I haven't hit any limitations, but I did, come up with a new approach and I actually got it [00:06:00] working. So I'm not going to spend any more time going through that video because I feel like everybody should just go dive into warp and experience it for yourself.

because it is fun, and it works pretty well. but coming back over to my screen, this app here is what I eventually built with warp and Cloud 3. 7's on it. when I started over from scratch and gave it a little bit more specifics on what I want to do, tried to reduce the scope on what was happening and just make it more simple.

So from this interface, you can choose a log or metric and. when you hit start streaming, it's actually going to start down here letting you know that something's happening and sending data to Datadog. And I can see over here in Warp, what's going on, the logs that are being pumped out and sent to my app.

And this is a server, or a Python, just like a proxy app that was built. One of the other things, and I'm going to switch this over to metrics too and let that run. More specifically, is I told it I want to [00:07:00] use Next.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Gotcha, yep.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:01]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> and that made the whole thing a lot, more just out of the box better. You know what I mean? Once I gave it those specifics, It actually, I thought produced a pretty good app.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:11]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I have noticed that Next. js and Tailwind do seem to be like keywords. I don't know if it's like when the models were trained and if it's like a cutoff date or something like that, but I wonder what the cutoff is for 3. 7 and whether or not It's a little bit later than something else.

Okay, so yeah, it's end of October 2024, which to me says that yeah, for things like Tailwind, for example, it's going to be a lot more knowledgeable, but probably also of other frameworks as well. That's really cool.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:36]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay, cool. so you can see it stopped here, and I've got this, one of the things in the new prompt that I gave it was to time out after 60 seconds.

I didn't want somebody to take this demo and start it and forget it was running and then just spam, their Datadog account with a bunch of stuff. So anyway, I baked in a little fail safe there, but

But anyway, if we pop over into Datadog, we can [00:08:00] see, these are the metrics that were coming in, I don't know if you saw over here on the right. The code is just dimmer, just generating random numbers to send over.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:08:08]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> but then down here in the logs, we can see, there's not a whole lot over here, but we can confirm this is coming from our app, the rest of it's all just generic stuff. There's the log message itself. a win, I would say, for an AI tool to help me build a really simple demo app that shows off some Datadog stuff.

And I think last time you were asking me about sample proms and things like that. I don't really have one for apps, but I will say I tend to go through the same kind of app as we were talking about radio, like a front end for an LM or something like this simple type of app between them.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:08:40]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> And I feel like a good way is to see what frameworks they pick on their own or when you give them one. How does it work with it? That kind of thing. So To me, at least, you get a good base to compare Cursor to at this point. I feel like it's massive. I'm just scratching the surface, but yeah, fair enough. I flirted with maybe playing with it over the weekend. [00:09:00] but then decided to just, start from scratch and just experience it together. so let me, I'm gonna close, Warp here. Sounds good.

I'm also interested because Courser has a terminal, which kind of does some of the stuff that I'm seeing in Warp, but also does not do some of the things that I see Warp can do. And I wonder if, because it can consume shells at least, maybe not terminals, but shells themselves. And I wonder if there's a way I can work with it.

Okay. Cool to see. .

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:24]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> It's immediately asking me about my keyboard setup and key bindings.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:28]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Now, are you Vim or Emacs? Where do you stand?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:31]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> The great debate.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:32]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Indeed.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:32]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Between Vim and Emacs, I'm certainly more Vim. Fair enough. But, to be honest VS Code is home for me.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:39]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> And it's for a lot of people these days, yeah. I thought this was interesting because, to me, the fact they included Atom and Sublime was cool. As somebody who used to like both of those a lot, and unfortunately I haven't used them in years, but yeah, I was a big fan.

I also found the fact that Vim and Emacs were the first was maybe indicative of their, who they're trying to win over in terms of hearts and [00:10:00] minds.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah VS Code just because that feels right for me. Language for AI. That's interesting. That's funny that you have that story because just this morning, I was doing some research using Perplexity. Confirming or looking up some additional stuff for a talk I'm about to give.

And Perplexity has this new advanced research thing. So it started stepping through all of its stuff and eventually it got to a source that I believe was in Spanish or Portuguese. and then the reasoning and all the text output switched to that language the rest of it.

I never said, to change or anything. It changed based on the source, which was weird. Anyway. Codebase wide, I guess I'll leave that enabled.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:42]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, my understanding is this is, if you've only got one file open in something like a mono repo, it might be interesting to not want to look at the entire codebase.

but in my case, it's not a big deal. I've just left it enabled.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:54]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, okay. And then I installed both of these, but I've never used them, so I'm not sure if they're key or not. [00:11:00] They do pop up a couple of permission things. Yeah, they might on Windows as well. and the same thing for cursor. I think it's just so you can one of them so you can open the browser, the other ones because it's got a little terminal tool that again, I've not used.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:11:12]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Okay, now this is another one.

one of the first ones, I think, is Pylance. When dealing with Python, and I think there's one For JS as well, that it uses making sure that it's running tests as it goes through.

Okay, this might pop you into another window, but I'm happy to waste some time while you're doing that.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:11:28]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> It did. That's all right. How about I'll just, we'll switch to my camera and, I'll set up an account.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:11:34]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Sure thing. And the thing that, just while you're doing this, I noticed, and you were talking about the free tier and warp, or not signing up and signing in.

as much as I love Cursor, and I have paid for it, prior to paying for it, I did run out of credits on that free account, and I ended up just signing up with two other email addresses, because, I got a few. I felt bad, I gotta be honest, because I know that they're paying for whatever this is on the back end, that they're just trying to get you in.

But once you get on a roll, and you probably felt this with [00:12:00] Warp, is you're just like, just one more thing. It's just, ah, just one more turn. It's this next one will fix this tiny little bug. But you're so close to having a fully fledged app, that it feels if you're telling your Assistant or your temp or somebody who's coming in with your code

And I just kept going and I would spend like I don't know 12 hours 14 hours and stuff But yeah I think the signup thing is interesting to me in terms of the way that they bring on People like it. They're trying to get people In for free basically to show them the utility and if we're going to think about what is it called proof of value if we're going to think of that kind of term, it felt to me like there was value immediately, but it took a little while for me to prove it.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:12:39]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> It sounds like your experience was very similar to mine with Warp. Yeah, exactly. I think we can switch over here to my right screen now. Perfect. So I did go ahead and just sign up. with my Google account. And that, took me to this screen. And now we're into what, oddly, looks like VS Code. I wouldn't say oddly. I think [00:13:00] that's intentional. Because it's basically VS Code. Yes. In terms of the back. I don't even know if fork is like the right term for this.

Okay. cool. So before we hit record, we talked about what should we do here. Should we start from scratch or actually show it some code and see what it thinks from that? I'm in the camp of let's show it the code that the other one created.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:13:22]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I might agree, actually. I feel like the ergonomics of setting up a new project are going to be the same with the same language model backend. I think in warp as in cursor, the difference is it's got a couple different ways of doing it. One is, I think it's called Composer, and the other one is Chat.

I guess there's three. And the third is as you're typing your text in. So those are different experiences. It might be a little bit different than Warp, but in terms of creating a piece of software, I think it'd be roughly the same.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:13:48]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> So we should open a project, and just point it at the, or go into our, let's see, Dev, and then Streaming App.

So this is the app that Warp helped [00:14:00] me create.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:01]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> And you'll see that there's a welcome on the top left. It just wants to make sure that you understand all the different modes. One is as you're typing. The next is to tell it to fix your code for you. The one after that, that I got a ton of value out of, is just asking questions of your code.

And then the last is chatting with your code base, which is where I spend most of my time. Asking questions of the code base. Is there a better way to do this? Is there some algorithm that I've forgotten?

Or do I really need a while loop here? That kind of stuff is really handy for me as somebody who can code, but doesn't do it all the time. Okay.

Yeah, they want you to onboard properly, I think is what they're saying.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:37]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay. we don't want to read the changelog right now, where do you suggest we go from here?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:42]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I would start at gitignore, just to see how well warp did with that, because this can be one of those things, because I see you've got an env file, and I don't want you to touch that.

Yeah. I do wonder if it's ignoring the env file in the gitignore, because this is one of those things that cursor can do, but doesn't always do properly. Okay.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:57]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> So let, hold on.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:59]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Did you do this on your [00:15:00] own though?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, I did this. No, no code has been, no code has been changed. This is all me. This is, this server. Oh, I see what's happening. Yeah. I

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:07]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> like this, but also I understand in Visual Studio Code, this is similar. I find it a little bit annoying when I've already got something that can handle Python and it's asking me for something else. Not the end of the world, but I think VS Code does that as well.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:21]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, I think it's best to just have maintain sort of the experience across. Yeah, everything anyway, that's why you chose okay, so that should be good to go for now. I'm sure we'll get more of those

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:35]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I think you can just click on that extension thing or the file manager there on the top left

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:42]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> All right.

So yeah, I don't know that we have to necessarily Examine this real close. But this is definitely Untouched since, being created with

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:52]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> a couple of things in here that I'll say just because I know Datadog is like the logs and metrics in point, end [00:16:00] point, like the intake end points can change.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:02]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> You just reminded me of something that I want to point out One thing it got wrong that I did not catch for the longest time is that in my Env file, which I can't show you because it'll show my keys.

But The name of that secret is DD Underscore API underscore key. Yeah, right and I think you yeah, so right here. However somewhere in the code It was datadog underscore API key.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:31]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I've had the exact same problem with Cursor. Where it creates multiple variables that do exactly the same thing and uses them interchangeably through your code.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:40]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Really, what I'm embarrassed is that I fed all the errors, I kept feeding the errors back into warp and it never even hinted or suggested that as a possible cause of why we were getting 404.

Four errors, I think, or four or three errors at the time. Anyway, it was just Oh that was a huge opportunity for [00:17:00] detecting what in the world is this not, why is it not working?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:02]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I wonder though, if this is a good friction log for us, because I bet you somewhere in our docs that it says Datadog API key, and then it says DDA API key, because I've seen both before in our docs.

I wonder if it's ingested old versions of the docs, and it's got some of that stuff in the memory, as well as the newer stuff, and then it's doing Two things at the same time. It feels like at this stage, in 2025, the current year, that it looks like, adjusting your documentation for AI use seems to be important, which is odd to me, but it does seem critical.

Especially in, I'm not sure if you've done it in Cursor yet, but you can add documentation. And depending on the form of the documentation, you'll have more or less success, basically.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:45]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I did see in a video that you can add docs as like a source.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:51]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> You were, I think, suggesting that we ask it to make sense of this code. Is that what your first suggestion was or what do you think? So PEP 8 is the style guide.

basically, so [00:18:00] it's one of these. earlier tickets from Python that will tell you basically that your project should look a certain way. now one thing that I will often do is grab my Python code and say hey, does this comply to PEP 8?

So PEP 8 is what it is. it means are there, did you hit enter after Your function, that kind of stuff, twice as opposed to once. So there's enough space there, because white space is important to Python for legibility. And again, not that this code is bad, I just wonder, looking at it, if there'd be a pep8 way to handle this file.

And I think at least on Mac, what it would generally do is use pylance to go through that stuff. But I wonder what Curse will do on Windows to see if it's compliant with pep8, basically.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:37]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay how do we put it through the ringer?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:40]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> We'll find out. I think what you can do here is, normally you'd select it all and then start a chat.

if you hit on the top right there, there's a little sidebar button just to the left of that. That one there.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:51]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Toggle AI pane.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:52]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I didn't know it was called AI pane. Composer is pretty handy when you want to update your code, seamlessly.

Okay. But the nice thing here is that you didn't need to control or [00:19:00] command A, that entire file to put into context. It knows already that the context, you can see on that first line there, is server. py. So it's got all of this in its context when you're talking to it. Now, on the model that you've got there, I wonder, are you able to pick 3.

7? I'm not sure if I've seen it yet. Oh, and there is a thinking. Okay. There we go. This makes a lot more sense. Gotcha. And then I just say Hey, is this file like PEP8 compliant?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:22]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay. So is this file,

P E P.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:28]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> And then eight, the number eight.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay, and then compliant.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:32]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, I guess that's the thing, but yeah, does it conform to PEP 8? Yeah, that should be fine. And then, yeah, you just hit, I think it's control enter or just What I like about this is a lot of that little, the ergonomics of just doing this kind of stuff is very easy. It doesn't take a lot of work. It's going pretty good, but that is a good failure though. I've yet to see this happen, but I wonder if 3. 7 is pretty popular.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:58]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, let's do it. Let's try it one more [00:20:00] time.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> It did pretty good though. It did say that, hey, there were some blank lines that you need to remove. There were some that you need to add, which is pretty cool. Overall, it's pretty good, but not there.

Okay, that's where, what I was hoping you would get to as well is that there are different packages that you can use that aren't part of VS code that may or may not be installed, that it can leverage when it's testing. And PyLance is the one that I was using, but it can do things like run pylint on your code on its own, which is like pretty amazing.

Now up here, you can apply this. And see how you can do it like, incrementally, you can do like little portions of it as well if you don't want to do the entire file. Which is handy, because sometimes it will mess up little pieces of code.

And then, you can see it looks pretty well the same and it's probably just added a space here and there, kind of thing, because Pep8 is rather specific.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:45]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, okay. But yeah, you don't get a diff or anything that tells you what

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:50]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> You do, yeah, if you scroll down, I think in that same window where you applied, you could actually do a diff, was my understanding.

But maybe that's in Composer mode? maybe because it already didn't It might be a [00:21:00] Composer thing, but Composer will give you a diff, and it would be in that same little, dropdown there. Which is pretty handy.

Run and say yes to all imagine if you're doing, like a yum install or an apt upgrade kind of thing, just YOLO made basically just say yes, say yes to everything, just do it like continue until it runs is a good one. that prompt that you had in the beginning in that you were defining how the app should work.

It looks like when I'm working with cursor, the better way to do it is to define test that should pass A user should be able to open a web page, type in their API key, hit submit, and see that the logs are there would be like a very similar to what you're saying, but phrasing it like a test, and it can continue through that until that is true, which is pretty interesting.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:42]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> There's another file that's part of this, the interface. I was going to just see if, should we stick with. Let's see what the reasoning model does. what we could ask it is there anything we can do to make this more accessible?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:54]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> There we go, yeah, that's perfect.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:59]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> yeah, [00:22:00] anything that can be done to make this, app interface more, accessible. without changing the primary color. I forget the color hex, so we're just going to hope that it can figure out purple.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:16]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I just know it starts with 632. I didn't know the rest of it.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:19]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Oh yeah. I know it when I see it at this point. Let's just go with this. I'm not going to give a lot more specifics. I thought about just saying, not only is there anything, but go ahead and do it, right?

Don't even ask it like a question about the error and it. It's not a bad presumption that I'd like to get to the bottom of this error, but.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:40]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> This is three weeks of meetings right here.

Even just having a proposal is very handy for this type of problem.

Wow.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:51]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay. Unsurprisingly, it found a lot.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:56]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I'm actually surprised because it's a very simple app. But yeah, there is a [00:23:00] lot in here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I think there are a lot of things that we can do to make things more accessible with the fonts and the colors and the spacing. the question is, Yeah, okay, we've got the apply all, so let's,

Yeah, so let me.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:14]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> OK, so from here you can start the terminal in Cursor. Because it's got a terminal that's similar, but not the same as Warp. Because it has some AI stuff in here as well.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:22]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Oh wait, we don't want to be in PowerShell though.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:23]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> In the chat you could actually say, Hey, how do I start my app? And it can tell you and you can run it from there.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:29]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Okay, so just how do I start my app?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:33]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah. And I wonder because one of the things that I noticed in Warp that it did was allow you to click on stuff to have it start.

Ah, look at that. Pip install. We don't have a requirements. txt, which is a good callout. Because there are some imports at the start of the file there.

But it says we can just do python server py. If you mouse over that, are you able to click it into the terminal? Yeah. Ah, it starts a new terminal, which is that's alright. [00:24:00]

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> That's fine. Yeah. Okay. So yeah, that's what I expected to look like. And then if we come over here and refresh, I think, yeah, so our app is working.

All right. So this is before. And then can we get back

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:12]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> just scroll up.

It's a lot. Okay. Massive mess. one of 10 changes.

And it feels like to me, I want to split that terminal out. I haven't tried that yet, but I do a lot in the terminal. So for me, it's mostly the editor of the terminal and the chat interface, and it feels like I want those to almost be windows on their own. Okay.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:38]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, I agree. I have the same problem in VS Code too.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:41]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Now, does it need to reload or is it hot reloading?

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:44]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I am checking. It doesn't look really any different.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:48]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Because I didn't even know hot reloading was a thing, full disclosure. Until I started playing around with JavaScript. It was a bit of an aha moment for me.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:55]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> The fact that you could just have the website update as you're editing your code. [00:25:00] It probably needs to restart it.

let's just kill it, and run it again.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:06]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> You can actually grab errors from this console, and add them as context to the chat as well, which is pretty nice.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:12]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Oh, neat.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:13]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah. Super handy.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:15]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Alright, let's bring this back, and

Let's see what it changed. Okay, so It looks the same. I wonder if floating in a different browser window would change it. But looking the same is a good thing.

I don't recall this, this purple highlighter.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> It did say it was changing the highlight, yeah.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:32]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> So that's cool. let's start sending some metrics over. Definitely nothing extreme.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:40]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Which is cool.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:41]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Let's go back to the last five minutes or so, and yep. Still works, and it's somehow more accessible. I bet you in the code too, it's a little more clear if we compared.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:54]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Should not be used in production. Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. They don't [00:26:00] want you using their CDN in Prod. That's not a bad call.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:02]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I feel like that's a success.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:04]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, absolutely.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:07]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Being able to just say, here's my code, make it better. didn't break anything.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:13]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Now there are a number of editors out there like this, and I think the only thing that came to mind when you were talking about warp, and I didn't want to put this in your brain, but it feels like to me warp is something that is, if there is a Venn diagram of editing, it feels like the terminal's part of the editor now, so like warp would be part of Cursor, which is part of something that uses Sonnet or other large language models, but can also use your docs, that kind of stuff.

But it feels like the editor's, what is it, the Emacs OS kind of thing? Like it's trying to become that entire all singing, all dancing, like start here and don't go anywhere else. Cursor's not there yet. Cursor's not that editor that's like the Emacs operating system yet. But it's awfully close. Like at this point in time, if Cursor could run a VM and click on stuff.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I would be very interested and it feels like the next step, like we're almost there.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:04]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> And it doesn't feel like it's really that far behind, or that it needs to be that far behind.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:07]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> No, they're very fast and updating and adding new stuff,

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:10]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> 7 was in there, for example, and that's brand new. Oh yeah.

And if it's always, you know really going to be closely representing what the latest and greatest that VS Code offers. They're also just piggybacking on great velocity with that tool.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:26]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Because they've changed the way that Copilot works in VS Code as well, which is similar to this now.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I've been using VS Code, not a ton, but up until Warp, the Warp Terminal, I've been using it for pretty much everything, but I've been Deliberately avoiding the new GitHub copilot like button and logo and everything because I wanted to save it for a deeper dive.

So I know it's there. I have clicked on it just to see how it would rearrange my screen. But then turn it off because I was like, I'm going to go back.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:56]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> The feedback I get from people about VS code in terms of negative is that it's slow or [00:28:00] slower than they expect and some of it's down to, you got 30 extensions installed, when you turn it on, it's going to check for updates.

Some people don't want any AI agent touching their code, that kind of thing. So for them, it's chat window only, please. Don't mess with my stuff, don't be in my terminal I'd rather all that is separate. Some people want it to be part of the whole app, and I think, Cursor's claim to fame on YouTube might be like, I made a full app in five minutes.

So I've heard other people playing with, WindSurf is one, JetBrains has its own kind of, AI stuff, so does Vim, so does Emacs now, so people are trying to use that as well. And then VS Code itself is changing a little bit, so it's, the space, and there's Bolt as well, yeah, the space is changing quite a bit.

There's Replit as well, which is a little bit different. Yeah, we're pretty close to time here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:28:43]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, I have a hard stop, so we do need to wrap this one up.

Go play with the Warp Terminal, because I just, I want to talk to other people about it, because it's just, I love it.

You get 3. 7 credits for free,

I need to spend more time with cursor, but I like it so far. It feels very comfortable. Feels just like VS code. [00:29:00] Obviously it does. It seems to be like does a lot of the same stuff that I just demonstrated you can do over and warp.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:29:05]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> So there's the experience is like comfortable already. I know how to have that conversation, so I just need to come up with some more time and some projects to play with.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:29:16]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> For me the thing that I like the most is docs is when I'm doing this stuff it's like a mini rag.

I have the docs for the thing I'm dealing with that I don't understand into this 'cause like, I'm lost.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:29:24]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> That would've saved me like an hour, I think. Oh, okay. With or because of what I told you. It was just wrong. It got the something wrong out of the docs and I assumed keep going. That it, I just didn't even look that close.

I want to wait until it doesn't work and then I have to get my eyes on it. I don't want to be there from the beginning of the code. I just want to help you troubleshoot. Let's get through this together anyway. So yeah, that was my experience.

And I think if I could have said here's the data dog docs, here's the source of truth at the beginning, I think we could have avoided me being down this path that I spent an hour.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:29:57]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I find I learned so much about our product just by [00:30:00] adding the docs into Cursor that it seems silly, but it's like we have new docs every day, every week, every month, and I'm always falling behind, so it's awesome for me to be able to have the current source of truth as I'm playing around with stuff.

Alright, we should probably wrap it up there, so for those of you watching, I hope this has been helpful. And we'll see you on the next one. Bye.

            <h3>Second Video: Website Updates with Claude Code</h3>
            <pre class="transcript-content" style="display: none;">
<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Hey there. Welcome back. I thought we'd do another experiment with an AI tool to see if we can solve a problem. That's. Sort of the point of a lot of these videos, if you've been keeping up is to go through some of the recent tools that have been announced and made available to us in the developer space and just see if they can solve our problems and how they work and have a better understanding of them.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And that's what we're here to do now. So I thought we would actually try to make some changes, some updates to my website. And my website is just as you can probably imagine, jason hand.com. And this is really just a template that I got from Netlify which is where it's deployed. Okay, I'm deploying it over here, Netlify.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And I just used this template that was available when you when you first create an account on Netlify. Made life easy for me. I didn't really wanna spend a lot of time designing a new site. I just wanted to get something going and then get some content in here. What I started it off with was an info page, which has got some stuff in here, including me, picture of me, some links to some different stuff.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Up here at the top we've got next projects. Projects are meant to be just recent things that I'm working on, whether that's. Webinars or speaking opportunities or my podcast just, variety of projects that I'm involved in. And there's a couple that I need to I need to add to here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And then thoughts was really just an experiment where I've taken some previous interviews of mine and summarize them using ai. And then broke them down into little sort of chunks. And it was, an experiment too. I'm not really into making writing blog posts and writing these huge things really that much anymore.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And, but I still wanted to have some thoughts and opinions out there. So I was just experimenting with this. But I think I'm gonna turn this off for now. In terms of a, just a feature of my website, I don't really wanna spend that much time on it. And. There's just other things I'd rather do.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:03:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> This AI section of my menu takes you to some of those links. So I still want to have this AI or, a link something up here to the AI experiments that, that is this, that we're working on. But I don't want it to go to this stuff anymore. And then in the dere. Page, I'd like to just change this so that it just says, listen to my podcast.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:03:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I don't want this stuff in there anymore. So I kinda went through it before I got on camera here and just jotted down some ideas that I want to do in terms of, or, take action on that. I want to wanna do this site including the main page. I wanna take these featured posts off since we're gonna be taking those thoughts.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> That's what those are. We'll make that disappear. Some changes to some footers. So anyway, long story short, I've got a file in here that is pretty much just a list of things that I want to do in the site, and we can go through them real quick. But my intention is actually to just pan this over to Claude Code.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Just the full to-do list and see what it thinks and what it can do for me. Because in my previous experiments with Claude, I was able to give it a list of things that I needed to do, and it, for the most part, handled it. And those were actually, I think, a little bit more complex than what I'm having this to do.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:05:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> This is a little bit more, I'm intending to give it a little bit more generic instructions rather than more specific instructions, but honestly, I don't care how it gets some of this stuff done or how it gets any of it done. Some of it's just a matter of adding some new files and text. The one thing that's a little bit tricky that I'm curious to see how it handles as I've asked it in my notes here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:05:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Let's see. And a new project page. Update the Devereux page. Yeah. This is a good start. If you're reading along here, I don't wanna read all this, but remove the thoughts menu from the option mark all thought takes as drafts and unpublish them. I guess that's the one I was thinking of that might be a little tricky on how that does that, because if you look at the code for this website it's just it's next JS for the most part and there's a lot of tailwind stuff.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:06:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I really haven't dug into the code, too much to see. To see how it works because again I don't really care. I just wanted, a decent looking website that was easy to update. And so anyway, what I wanna do is just take all of this stuff from my to-do list and move it into Claude code.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:06:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And let's make this just a little bit smaller now and see what see what happens. So what what I'm gonna do is I've got, I've already got if we look at our directory let's first go into dev and then look around. We have this personal web folder, which is the code base. My code. We can see that over here. This is personal web, so that's the repository. I've already cloned it down into my machine. So we're gonna go into personal web and you can see it's it already detects that this is a GitHub repo.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> All right. And we can look around in here just to confirm that this is what we think it is and it is. So what I wanna do is from here, this is the root of my code base, is let's summon Claude by just typing in Claude. And we've got some questions here. And let me make this just a little bit bigger so we can see everything.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Do you trust the files in this folder? This is my personal footer and gives me some different. Details about that on executing code and that kind of thing. I'm gonna say yes. And now I'm free to let's make this a little smaller so everything fits. Now I'm free to start asking questions. So I'm going to tell Claude my intentions here on what I'd like to do with my code.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:08:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And I'm gonna paste in that to-do list of everything that we have. And then we'll just watch and see what happens. Alright, so I have a website that is built using the code base we are in currently. I just reviewed the site and have a list of updates I'd like to make and hope you can help me with this.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:08:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> That here is the list of things I want done and I believe I can shift enter. Nope, I think I did that last time. Okay. At least it didn't start spinning off here. So let me copy the to-do list and paste that in. We'll paste. Anyway, now that Claude knows what I want, we'll just sit here and see what it thinks.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And what I think I'll do also is just open up vs code and open up that project. Bring that over here. We'll go ahead and do this and a couple housekeeping things we needed to do here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay. So we have that ready to go and let's just check in on Claude. Still transmuting. I haven't counted how many, oh, hey. We just got okay. Do you wanna make this edit to config file? Yes. And let's go ahead and give it permission to just do all that. For the rest of this session, so we're not answering yes for everything, giving up a little control there, but that's the experiment to see what it does without too much interaction and intervention from me.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:11:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> But anyway, I want to pull up, I guess I can just open up another terminal here. And so if we go in and let me just make this bigger and we'll look around here. Just looking at the list of things that we're doing, so removing the thoughts. Thing from the menu Mark. All thought takes. I explained some of those down here. I wanted to add a new project. So recently I spoke at a conference in Pasadena called the Southern California Linux Con Expo. And I wanted to add details about that.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:12:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I also wanted to I found like I ha I have a little sh Etsy store link that I used for my podcast. But I've decided not to continue using that. So anyway, I'm taking that out of the links section. I'm gonna replace it with my YouTube link since I'm starting to put more stuff on YouTube now.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:12:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And then yeah, so the, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. So that was basically what I was trying to get at is how many things did I give it to do? And the answer is 11. Alright, so although it came back here with a list of nine things that it accomplished, let's see what it has. I've completed all the requested updates, removed with thoughts, menu option, all the thoughts posts will be hidden and they're now filtered out in the get all posts sorted.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:13:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Interesting. Added new menu options for Ignite Karaoke, which takes you to Yeah, hopefully. And then great. I like that it adds a little emoji here. It's fun. Okay, so all changes have been implemented successfully. Does that mean Yeah. Look at that. So the config file changed, index, bunch of files changed. Alright, let's just real quick. Look, take a quick visual snapshot of what our main website looks like here. And then I'm gonna go ahead. I know I could, do all this locally, but part of the experiment that I'm doing with all these is trying to trust it on what it's created for me.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And I don't want to do a lot of back and forth changes. It's not that hard for me to just commit nude code, if that's what we're gonna do and this is Claude Code updates.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> All right, so that's been, code's been pushed out. We can verify that we come over here and just do a quick refresh. We'll see that. Few files. Now have a now indicator and if we go into netlify, maybe do a refresh here. We should see that we've got a new deployment firing up and this one will take a little bit of time for it to cook and build. Hopefully we'll see some different. Different menu options up here. At least one more project listed in here. All these featured posts should go away. That whole section should go away, and there sh should be some differences in the footer.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> We're just watching our build process here over on Netlify. Initializing step is done.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> All right. Okay, so everything looks like it has completed successfully, and we can. Open our production deploy and look at that. The top has definitely changed, I think. I'm gonna have to go back and tell to remove that though. 'cause I didn't get, I forgot, I didn't get real specific on that part. Okay.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And look at this. What, oh, wait. I think it's just that. That's the one I had already, I think. Okay. 'cause I did have, I guess it's true. I did have an article in there, a project in there stating I was gonna be speaking. So we'll take a look at it closer. But it did remove all of the thought takes. That's good.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And there was a change down here, which is good. There's supposed to be some, there was something down here previously, and now let's go look up here and info. It took my shopping link away and added my YouTube page, which is good. Great. And I don't see any real big changes in here, but I think also. I might have not been per perfectly clear on what I wanted there. I also was not clear on removing all this stuff that was just something I was thinking out loud, but didn't actually put in there. It did get this part right to just go listen to my podcast.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Now I want to add some images in here and now Ignite Karaoke. Oh look, I think I wanted it to go into a new tab, but, it's still fun that it did it. Now it just feels like it's baked in into my website and yeah. So we'll let this finish up just 'cause I like seeing these pictures sometimes.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> All right, technically that works. And then I get you. I bet you this one, yeah, this works too. Sweet. I did want it to open up in a new tab. That's okay. And then this one comes to our experiments tab. Okay. So yeah, we're pretty close. I tell you what let's just see if we can clean it up. Let's make a few more changes. Move the AI menu option. Leave the AI experiments.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And then if possible, force a new tab to open when users click. The karaoke vinyl viewer or AI experiments menu option. Now, this is interesting because. Depending on how this is actually implemented in the code it's not gonna be a straightforward solution because to do it, to have some of the menu options not do that. Some of 'em open in a new tab and some of 'em don't.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Is gonna be the challenge. Now, I don't really want everything opening up in a new tab. I just wanted the karaoke, the vinyl viewer and the AI experiments ones to open in a new tab. But if I can't figure out a good way to handle this and keep like the projects and the other stuff there, I may just move those links to a different place instead of having them as menu options.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Because the menu op, the menu's kind of getting large, excuse me, the menu's getting a little long and anyway, but let's, let's do this. Let's see what it thinks we should do here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay. You can see there. You can see there where it's got the target equals under blank in quotes. That, that's what you would put in like an a, like a hyperlink to make it work in the, in HTML. But again, I don't know that you can do that for a, all the menus. It'll be interesting because also this isn't just a straightforward, like HTML and JavaScript app. It's a next JS app. So it's JavaScript at, its core, but I didn't create it and it's definitely got a lot of stuff in there that I'm not using.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Looking at these suggestions here, it's making some changes to some TypeScript files, which is more than I expected it to do. Okay. Alright. I got some, I got an update. Perfect. I've now removed the AI menu option from the config. JSON updated the action component to correctly handle the target attribute. Okay. Added the target property to the link model and the CMS ensured that the link component passes the target attribute along shown, okay, keep.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay. Interesting. All right, let's see. Let's see if it's true. Pull our code back up. Oops. And we'll go ahead and add all this in here. Again. I know I could check this locally. I. If you're wondering why is that fool not just checking things locally, we're just yellowing stuff into production for these experiments.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And I'm just gonna call this more cleanup. And let's come over here and take a look to a new refresh. Oops. Not that one. And then we just watch our deployment. I'm noticing some PHP in here. A little surprised.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay. I think we almost there and that shouldn't be it. So let's do a quick refresh here and we've gotten rid of our AI link at the top. That's good. And then, and you know what, I'm just gonna do a hold down the shift key and hit a refresh here. Just make sure I. And what we expect now for these three links that they open up in a new tab.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Ta-da, vinyl viewer, AI experiments. Sweet. Okay, but not derel, and not projects, and not info. Just ignite karaoke. Alright. So what did we learn? We learned that we can pretty much give Claude a huge list of things that you want done with very little explicit instructions. And it's gonna get, it's gonna get most of the way there.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Yeah, I feel like that was pretty, pretty much a success. Crash and burn. I. Yeah. All right. And this is this is what it was in the original shape. Okay. Now we've got, so it was 1, 2, 3, 5. Now we got rid of that one, added a few more. And I bet you if we just do a quick refresh over here.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:28:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> So there we have it. Now we've got updates to the website, and Claude Code helped me do all that in almost exactly 30 minutes. And I didn't have to write any code. I knew you know how to. Do all that stuff manually, but honestly a lot of it's just gonna be copying and pasting and duplicating files to start as a, to use as a starting point.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:28:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And then yeah, so it's gonna be a much easier moving forward to keep my website up to date just simply by creating a list of things I need done, dropping it into Claude Code or. A lot of them are gonna work the same way, but just dropping all that in there and then letting it see what it can do.

<span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:29:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> So I hope this video has been helpful for you and we'll see you on the next one.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Hi everyone. In a previous video, I went into a tool called Cursor and explored what you could do with that came up some really fun and interesting things, and you should go watch that video. You can go check that out here at the AI Labs experiments and related tools page that we've set up. I will include a link to this site that you can go look that all up.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Check it out. But for the purposes of this video, what I thought we would do is take cursor to another place and give it another experiment and just see how it handles it. So what I wanted to do today is actually go back into one of the projects that I worked on a long time ago that I just called the vinyl viewer, and we'll open up this repo and the vinyl viewer was just like a weekend project.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I did, you can see last updated 10 months ago. So it's been a while. It's nothing more than a JavaScript an HTML and CSS site. You could stand up yourself and run if you'd like. And I've got it set up running here as a GitHub page so you can actually see it in action. We can run through the demo and all it is is just displaying these little vinyl platters, these, final disc final records with some text over it. And you can see there's a number for each one. And it's not every one of my records, but it's most of them. It's a lot of them.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:01:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I'll have to admit that there's probably a lot more in here than I really need. But I do have quite a few of them and it allows me to click on one and then real quickly look at information about that record. And even listen to a clip so we can Alison Brown there before YouTube takes me down for copyright violations. But you get the idea here. I can scroll through scroll through everything and check out the records. There's a lot of records here though, so you know, finding something is a little bit of a challenge.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And of course I added this search bar at the top and I have quite a few Frank Zappa records. So if I just filter out Frank Zappa you can see it. It actually does a pretty good job. It does a great job actually. It shows all of my Frank Zappa records. However, when I click on the record, you can see this is the high woman. That's not Frank Zappa. This is Silver Bullets. Chung's revenge is pulling up. Watch House Jazz from Hell is pulling up some bluegrass. Something's not quite right with this whole setup.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> This is pulling up some kings of Leon. So I have some ideas, I have some theories about what's going on, but I've never taken the time to actually track down. Why it's behaving the way it is. So I thought maybe this could be a job for Cursor. So let's actually pull up Cursor and I'm already connected to the Vinyl Viewer project. I got that set up already and.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:03:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I think all I really want to do, or what I think I need to do is chat with Claude and we're gonna use Claude Sonet thinking 3.7 Sonic thinking. I'm just gonna tell it basically what I just told you, that this application seems to work. However, there's a problem with search and. I'd like to try to track down what's going on. I feel like that might be a little bit of a tall order, but we're gonna see that's what we're here to do. Okay, so in this project, the app displays the correct results when the user searches for something.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> However, the user clicks on the image from the search results, clicks on one of the images I. A different record is displayed. And what's funny in here is I'm saying record, but I actually mean record. I just don't mean the same record for the record. So a different record is displayed. This is not the desired behavior. How can we figure out the problem and correct it?

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:05:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> So I'm being a little specific slash pedantic. I dunno if pedantic is the right word, but I'm trying to be pretty, pretty detailed in what we're doing here without leading it on too much. And let's just see. Let's see what happens. So I'm gonna scroll, I'm gonna let it run through just a little bit more. It's coming up with some code fixes, some code changes, I should say. Let's go back. Okay. So we need to diagnose while clicking on a search result shows a different record than what was displayed. Yes. First we need to understand the data flow.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:05:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Yeah. Incorrect ID being passed when a user clicks. Yeah. Caching problems. Yeah. Not sure about race condition. I feel like that's probably not what's going on. Alright. So without seeing the actual code, I'll need to provide a general diagnostic. So I think. I need to let it know that it can look at this code. Right.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:06:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Alright. So it's given me some suggestions on different ways to put in some better debugging, and then it once again says without seeing the specific code, so let's add the code and I wanna say. If we just give it probably the index file as well as this script js file found here, we should be good. But it'd be nice if I could just tell it to say this whole thing is the project. I just want you to take a look at the whole directory, but for now we'll keep it to this, although I wonder if images has anything to do with that.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:06:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I doubt it. I don't. I don't remember if there's anything in there. Okay. These are the primary files with the code that needs to be evaluated. All right. Okay, here we go. I defined where I dropped it in. So let's an analyze.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Looking at the code, I can see the problem. When this user searches, the app creates a new array called filtered data, containing only the records that match the search. However, when the user clicks on a card, the click handler is using the original JSON data array. To find the record to display not the filtered data array. That makes sense. All right, so it's saying I can apply this to the index file. Let's go ahead and do that.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Now. The problem is that after filtering the indices in the card container no longer aligned with the indices in the original JSON data array. When you click on a card, the code is determining its position in the card container and then using the index to access the original data, which is incorrect. The solution is simple. When a user has performed a search, the app should use filter data array. Yeah. Okay. Fixed search results displaying wrong record and click okay. Here's the fix for the existing code of the script file.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:08:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> I'm gonna go ahead and apply that. What I like about this method, more than like a chat, GPT, is the lack of copying and pasting means less errors. But also anytime you see this like existing code stuff, sometimes it, it gives you like a bunch of blocks. And it's just hard to decipher like where in your existing code that's supposed to go when it just shows existing code. So this is definitely a much nicer experience.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:08:30]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> What's happening, the bug occurs because when you search, the app creates a new array called filtered data. However, when you click a cards, looking at the JSON data, the fix mixes, code check, we're currently just fine. Okay, cool. Alright, so we've made these changes. I'm gonna accept the file, accept the changes there, and let's go ahead and I need to mark this as safe. Close that and we will add bug squashing now. Maybe say bug hunting for now.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> And while that's doing its thing, we should be able to pull this up here and there's nothing really happening. There's no actions. I guess it does have a minor build that takes place.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay, we'll open this up. So this is our new app here. Everything looks. Looks good.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:11:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay, now here's the big reveal. Search for Zappa Equipped to the front. Will this be sleep Dirt? No, it's not sleep dirt. It's Ray Mont. Will this be Chung's revenge? No. Okay. Oh, we got something though. That's a no. Okay.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:12:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> So we still don't have a fix. Interesting. After all those changes, all we did was change the script file. Did the index file not get changed? Let me add the script back in here just for context and make sure.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:13:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Yeah I'm not real sure. I know I said apply all. Okay. It doesn't think there's anything wrong. I'm go ahead and apply this. It's odd that it didn't ask me to save anything though.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Okay. Let's apply that. And we'll go ahead and do this, which will be some for some better debugging. We don't wanna do that. That's our secondary backup plan. All right, let's go ahead and accept these changes. And I believe it still doesn't ship my index files needing to be pushed up, which just doesn't make sense.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> All right, we'll let this finish building and if we don't have a fix, I think we will pause. Okay. Another thing it does too, I should have said, is it randomizes the order every time. So like Frampton's first here, and then if I refresh it that way, 'cause there's so many of these, like I just didn't wanna always be looking at the same ones. So the order is always randomized, but they're all there.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Let's see what happens. Oh, hey, look at that. OMG Act one and two. Hot diggity. Alright, so who else do I have a bunch of stuff from? How about yeah, a couple. Casey Musgraves. How about Ryan Adams got a couple of him. He's got a bunch of him. Excellent. Cool. A different Tony Rise, different Tony's I can also open this up over in disc cogs. So cool.

                <span class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:00]</span> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason:</span> Wow. I can't tell you how good it feels to have that bug squashed. So another win for Cursor helped me fix a 10, 10 month old bug in my website. And yeah, I think that's all I wanted to share. We'll see you next time.
