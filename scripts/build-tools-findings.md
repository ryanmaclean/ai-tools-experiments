# JavaScript Build Tool Evaluation Findings

## Test Environment
- **Local Environment**: macOS ARM64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Docker Environment**: Linux ARM64
- **Test Date**: May 4, 2025

## Benchmark Results Summary

### macOS ARM64 Results

| Build Tool | Build Time | Bundle Size | Status |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| ESBuild | 101ms | 41.57 KB | Inconsistent (sometimes fails) |
| Rolldown | 110ms | N/A | No output (early development) |
| Rspack | 331ms | 41.57 KB | Reliable |
| Rollup | 380ms | 76.28 KB | Reliable |
| Vite | 368ms | N/A | No output in our tests |
| Webpack | 1044ms | 41.36 KB | Reliable but slow |

### Docker Linux ARM64 Results

| Build Tool | Build Time | Bundle Size | Status |
|------------|------------|------------|--------|
| ESBuild | 78ms | N/A | Failed |
| Rspack | 184ms | 41.57 KB | Reliable |
| Rollup | 668ms | 76.28 KB | Reliable but slower |
| Webpack | 1544ms | 41.37 KB | Reliable but very slow |

## Key Findings

1. **Rspack Performance**:
   - Consistently fast across environments (184-331ms)
   - Successfully produces correct output bundles
   - Rust-based for better performance
   - Maintains similar bundle size to webpack and esbuild
   - Supported by ByteDance (TikTok parent company)

2. **Cross-Architecture Compatibility**:
   - Rspack worked reliably on both ARM64 environments
   - No native module issues observed with Rspack unlike ESBuild/Rollup
   - Does not appear to be affected by npm bug #4828

3. **Drawbacks & Considerations**:
   - Newer tool with smaller community compared to webpack
   - Plugin ecosystem not as mature
   - Documentation may not be as comprehensive
   - Configuration schema similar but not identical to webpack

## Recommendation

Rspack represents the best balance of:
- Modern performance (Rust-based)
- Cross-architecture compatibility
- Output reliability
- Build speed

For our Netlify deployments, migrating from ESBuild to Rspack would address our ARM64 compatibility issues while significantly improving build performance compared to webpack or Rollup.

The migration should be approached in phases with proper testing at each stage to ensure production stability remains the top priority.
