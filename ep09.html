            <h1>From GTC to Website Building with AI Tools</h1>
            
            <p>In this episode, Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean discuss their experiences at NVIDIA's GTC conference in San Jose, where over 25,000 attendees gathered for what they described as the "Super Bowl of AI conferences." They share insights from the conference, highlighting the shift from curiosity to practical implementation in the AI industry, with many attendees seeking guidance on production readiness, hallucination detection, and security concerns. Ryan then demonstrates how he used Claude Code to create a website for their AI tools experiments project, complete with a feedback form that sends data to Datadog. He also showcases several personal projects he enhanced using Claude Code, including a vinyl record collection viewer, an Ignite Karaoke tool, and a cat adoption application called "A Call of Cats." The episode concludes with plans to explore Windsurf IDE in their next session.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=0" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:00]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Hey Jason.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:01]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Hey, how's it going?

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=2" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:02]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Not too bad. I wanna say it's been a minute, but yeah, I just saw you last week. Actually a couple days.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=11" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:11]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> It's been like five minutes or something. Yeah, a little bit longer. Not as long as it usually is. Good to see you again.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=15" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:15]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> For sure. Where were we last week? What were we doing again? Remind me, we,

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=18" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:18]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> yeah, we went to San Jose, California for NVIDIA's GTC conference, the Super Bowl of AI conferences, as they liked to, to say often last week. Yeah, it was good. We.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=31" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:31]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Go ahead. It felt like the Super Bowl. There were a lot of people there. It was fairly busy.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=35" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:35]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I feel like I saw a different side of the conference that you did. I was at the booth for four days. Whereas I think you got to see some sessions, which is pretty interesting, but. It felt a lot bigger this year than last year, and a lot of the stories I heard of were people, boots on the ground trying to actually get stuff running, some experience, some dev stuff, some staging, a little bit of pride here and there. But yeah, it sounds like people are actually trying to get some work done now, which is awesome.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=58" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:00:58]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah. My, my take is same stuff. It's gotten bigger, I think there's 25,000 plus people there this year. They've expanded as you saw. They've opened up. Like the park in the middle of downtown San Jose and just blocked that all off. And that's where we would go for lunch or just to get outside. There was lines for all of the sessions, every session. I went to 15 different sessions over the week and there was, I always waited in a line of 30 minutes or more. It was a lot and a lot of people. And yeah, I needed the weekend to recover. I'm not sure I fully have, but I do have a lot of notes from stuff I need to go back and check out. To your point, I think there's more people doing more now. Last year, it seemed like a lot of looky-loos and just curious people like, like me and just trying to understand what are people doing, what are people experimenting with? And now people are actually building some really interesting things. The sessions I went to were all like high quality way, way much larger improvements than I expected from last year. There's a few dozens right from last year that I went to that I was like, that was a waste. And that didn't happen this year.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=123" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:03]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Oh, that's fantastic.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=124" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:04]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah they were all really good. I met with some really great people some contacts and some friends at Nvidia that I only get to see there. So overall, yeah, it was a great week. We found, we, we went and had a good time at our favorite vegan vinyl restaurant. Absolutely place. And yeah, it's just a good good week of learning and soaking things up and now I gotta. Take my notes and try to do something interesting. Just could just coalesce all the knowledge together.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=149" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:29]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=149" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:29]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Now, one thing I did do is go around booths, looking around to see if there's anything there to be seen. There was, there were a lot of robots there, there were last year as well, but there were a lot of mechanical arms to do surgeries remotely and stuff like that. I think my favorite was that it was at the pebble flow, the the electric trailer thing that we saw.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=167" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:47]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=168" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:48]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I don't know, maybe it's because I could get inside of something and look around that. It was novel to me, but I thought that was pretty cool and I didn't expect to see vehicles at an event like this, but there were definitely test drives as well, which I thought was interesting.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=179" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:02:59]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> That was very cool actually. And I don't know if how this will work, but I'll, I'm switch to my desktop real quick, just 'cause I have gtc Oh, website up. But it's yeah, the, there was a lot of humanoid robots, just a lot of robotics in general. And autonomous vehicles. There were more different autonomous vehicles this year. And then to your point, the pebble which is this really neat camping trailer that has. It's a smart trailer essentially. And not only is it, electric and you can live off the grid and got some really cool features like that, but it'll also, it's got its own drive train, so it'll help with the driving and cut back on, the fuel efficiency. That it's, that something like that would be, sucking outta you. So yeah, it was a really cool, I wish I had the money for type of toy, but same thing. I think it was 170 5K was the one that we were looking at in US dollars. It was like Canadian. It's quite, it had that one feature though, that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=232" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:03:52]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> What was it called? The smart hitch or magnetic hitch or something like that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=235" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:03:55]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Magic tow Magic hit magic Tow Magic. Could be magic hitch or something along those lines. But yeah, it just it'll, using the app, you can drive it and actually hitch onto your vehicle. Amazing. You can pivot it around so you can maneuver it into really tight spaces. So yeah. Different type of ai. I am sure, somewhere in that thing in the app least. But it was fun. It was a really cool little trailer thing.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=256" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:16]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Definitely it feels like the apply the application of Gen AI to some of these topics, I think it's maybe when it's in the physical realm is obvious to me. And I guess spending most of the day with, chat bots or ides or APIs, it's nice to see some of this in the physical world. I, it's scary as some of the, remote procedure robots and stuff like that are, I think that is.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=275" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:04:35]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Future, and these are early days, so it can only get better than where they are right now. And I did see somebody manipulating little little elastic bands, for example, with these tiny little oh yeah, manipulators, I guess they're called Surgical. Surgical manipulators. Yeah. It was very interesting to see someone just off the street with a, like a VR headset, just picking up a robotic arm and picking up this tiny little elastic band in flexing, I thought was pretty cool. Yeah, pretty impressive. And good to know that. You know that there's advancements like that, in medicine that are beneficial from a lot of this stuff. So I, I'm curious if there's any, you hung, you said you hung out at the booth quite a bit more and this year and was there any themes, any interesting conversations that came up at, at your time at the booth that you wanted to share with us?

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=320" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:05:20]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Obviously Datadog's got features and things like that. So as I'm going through them, some things will resonate with people more than others. The main one that, that we were talking about was hallucination detection. That seemed to strike a chord with a lot of people in terms of the non-deterministic way that an API or a large language model may answer. There were people asking about things like on-prem or air gap. So I think security also seemed to be a little bit of concern, either in the way that they're deploying things. Or in terms of what they're adding to the models or perhaps their clients may be using them for, there are only a few people talking about what they're doing in prod. A lot of them were a little bit hesitant in Devon staging in terms of what they had not being confident to push that into prod just yet. So they're in their experimental phase and they're worried I hate to use the word governance 'cause it's not that exciting. But in terms of on the backend, so you've deployed something, it seems to be working, and then what would those failure modes. B basically. So it's a fear of the unknown, maybe a bit of uncertainty and doubt in terms of what that would look like once it becomes in productionized, I hate to use this term, but once it becomes the production feature, what are those things of concern? One of them seems to be, I. Being able to make them deterministic, either via caching or a database or reg or what have you. The other is more around that security, so ensuring that there's no PII going into this system 'cause they don't want it. Two, that if it's being fine tuned that there's nothing coming out of it that might be sensitive. And then thirdly, just that security itself. So it, there, there were only a couple people talking about wallet attacks. So imagine you've got a competitor. On your chat bot just, typing in stuff in order to hit your backend API. So you get out a quota and then you have to downgrade your service, that kind of thing. But that came up as well as a bit of a concern is that a lot of these API calls if in the cloud may cost money, and as a result, the question is how do I. Stem or stop this flow basically of people coming in and maybe abusing my service or overusing my service that they're overzealous and what does that look like? How can I implement a quota system or find that one user and maybe slow down the API request rate that they got. But there were some interesting things that honestly, I hadn't thought of. 'cause that one came up and I hadn't thought of the a, a wallet attack kind of way, but it's more about rate limiting, at the end of the day. But there were quite a few concerns about, not how do I get started, but more like we, we have started, what do we need to know before we go into production basically? So again, I thought was fantastic. I think if that's the state of maturity that we're at after one year, that tells me that this is growing pretty fast. And I guess it, it tells you and I that the rationale for having a conversation like this is important because a lot of people are still learning on a regular basis and it's growing by leaps and bounds.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=472" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:07:52]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah. Yep. That was my experience too, and I know every time I came back by the booth after, in between sessions there was always a huge crowd. You were often there giving demos to like, usually one or two people and then two people behind them were also kinda looking over their shoulder and then two people were looking over their, it was trying to project a bit. Yeah. And I even hung out there off oftentimes if I couldn't get into a session, which happens because again, there's just so many people there. So I would come back and I got into a lot of good conversations and answering questions just 'cause there were so many people around. And, we were crammed in between Crew AI and Fiddler, and then there was like 11 labs and there's a lot of like notable, companies in the space right around us. And then you'll see somebody come up to us and it'll get, go one of two ways, either no Datadog, and they're like, what are you doing over here with all these tools? And what do you, and also what do you have to do about with ai? Tell me more. And then there's other people who, came up to me telling, saying that they. We'd love to work with us whenever we're ready for a round of funding. I just have no idea who we are and think we're over a small company over here with the startup. They thought we were series C or something yet. Yeah. Which was, it's fun. You get a lot of, you get a lot of interesting people coming to the booth.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=540" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:00]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Definitely heard that and leading up to it. I think you had actually done a bunch of work, so we didn't have to do too much today. What did it seems like you've been very busy. Do you rest?

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=550" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:10]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> It's like working out, you sometimes you can't, it can't always be leg day. You gotta have rest once in a while.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=554" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:14]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> That's true. That's true.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=555" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:09:15]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Lately my hours have dipped, but I think a lot of that's 'cause it's, 'cause daylight saving has given us back more time and Right. Yeah. I'm just more productive this time of year. But yeah, I did before we went on. On our trip to out to San Jose for the conference I worked on a few things because we knew we were gonna be gone. We weren't trying to have an episode every week. That's just a thing we're trying to stick with. And I had some free time without, Ryan and I had, didn't have time to get together a bunch, but I had been able to go and play with a few tools on my own. Some things that we've already talked about Cursor, which was one episode that, we did. Couple weeks ago I've been playing around with Claude Code, which is another right really fun tool. And so I actually spent a lot of time using Claude code. And I'm gonna switch over to my de desktop here.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=600" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:00]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Sure.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=601" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:01]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> The site looks way better.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=603" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:03]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=604" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:10:04]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> So I used Claude code essentially to create a website for us. So if you remember previously we had the. The whole thing was on GitHub as far as what we're pointing people to, right? Here inside the AI tools experiments. This is just, whoops, runway. This is where we were gonna have everything, right? So I went ahead and I'm in the way here, but I went ahead and put in a link that just takes you to where did it go? Take Tuesday here now. And essentially what I've done is created an episode for every. Everything that we've done so far, and I think we were up to we went over automatic 1111 a couple weeks ago with when you are showing us some stuff and then really these next five I. The result of me some on the weekend, but some I did like in Fri like last Thursday and Friday, and I was on a roll and I just kept hitting and record with what I was doing. And so if you go back and look I'll just explain briefly what these are. This first one here is, you had Ryan suggested. When we were doing the automatic 1111 that we add a feedback form of some right. Of some type for every, everybody to like, just give us some feedback, give us some suggestions on what you'd like to hear. So that got me thinking like, how can I add a feedback form? And I decided I, we, I need a website to put that feedback form on. So what this video does is we'll take you and I've got it on YouTube. It's unlisted. But it'll take you to the video here. If you click on the image and it'll. Basically walk you through what I did to create this website. And a lot of it's just HH TM L, JavaScript, CSS, nothing really fancy going on, and my intention was to make it a GitHub page. But the problem is, in order to do, down here at the very bottom is the feedback form that I added. And in order to do a feedback form, there's. There's some, things you have to consider in terms of where it's hosted and it's not exactly, I don't know if it's completely infeasible or unfeasible, whatever the word is to do it. But it's more difficult to set up a, for something that submits a. Feedback from a GitHub page, right? And I ran into those problems. I expected I'd run into those problems, but I wanted to see how Claude would handle it. And so eventually we it suggested a pivot that we make this site a little bit more advanced and we go ahead and deploy it onto Netlify with a proxy server that can handle our cores. Communication. So sending, sending stuff, cross scripting stuff is basically what it's trying to prevent you from doing. And so it cloud code helped me write a little serverless function that I added to my repo that has everything with the website, stuff that Claude also helped, cloud Code helped me reach write. And then I deployed it in net into Netlify after a little bit of back and forth with a few minor errors in the in the build and deployment process. We. Finally got it working works great. And the feedback form is, as you can see, it's nothing fancy. In fact, okay, I need to add some more fields and make it a little bit more helpful. I just wanted it to be functional at this point, right? But what I've got happening is you can put in your stuff here if I can remember my email address and talk at the same time. It's always video trying to type and talk. Okay. Yeah. And so we're talking about cloud code here and I don't know, we'll say something new and when I hit submit here you get, we get a little feedback thing here from Chrome, but otherwise, you don't know what happened here. What I did just for funsies, honestly, and to see if you could do it, which is why I do a lot of things. I had it sending that feedback, that form data over into Datadog.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=829" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:13:49]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Oh, gotcha.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=829" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:13:49]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> So I can actually see it in, lemme see if I can pull up Datadog here. But we can let's see. Do I have, are you sending this like a metric, like form created plus one or just a a custom log, basically.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=841" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:01]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Oh, a log. Okay. Gotcha. Yep.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=843" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:03]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> And. And then presumably going through, you could gr these logs or reject them or something like that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=851" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:11]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah I haven't quite got to that because we're not getting any feedback in, and I haven't just wanted to, I sorry. Write some feedback on those one to one, Pump on all that stuff here. But yeah, ideally I'll be able to go in and start to see all that stuff. And actually here, I'll switch to my screen now that I can show it. So yeah, in Datadog here I can see the. Like again, there's not much coming over. Yeah. So can js on so we can parse it out. That's pretty cool. Yeah. Add more fields in here, but then to your point, I think I could set up some monitoring or some alerting or maybe even a workflow to have something else happen, maybe to let me know that some feedback came in or Right. To sign for a mailing list or something.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=890" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:50]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Something dubious.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=892" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:14:52]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah. Oh yeah. I dunno about that. But but yeah, something along those lines, just to make it, it's a little bit more interactive for me, so I don't just have to go into the dashboard and look to see if we've got feedback right. But that was, all just off your idea to add a feedback form. Then I got to thinking I, I think I need a website, like a proper website, not just a GitHub page, but I need a real website unless, this is the other thing. I could have just done a Google form or of course, there's a million other form deployments out there, but like that, where's the fun in that, and I'm always looking for some ways to like. Do something weird with Datadog, just like abuse the platform in fun ways. Maybe abuse is not the right word, but use it in ways. Leverage, it wasn't intended to be a form submission tool. Novel usage.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=933" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:15:33]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, for sure. Yeah, exactly. Novels may be better, but yeah, so did that. And then that was that first episode that I recorded and in the next ones I basically went through. All of the projects that I've worked on. If I go back into my into my GitHub, a lot of these projects that I have down here for example, the vinyl viewer one. Which is just a way for me to view my vinyl record collection. As well as the Ignite Karaoke one, which is one I built for the team. And then decided to just make out, put out there. And then this last one here, this it's pronounced. A little weird but yes, he tell you a call of cats.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=972" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:12]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, it's hard. Exactly. And especially if you can't see my mouth. But anyway I think everybody who owns a cat knows what it says. So that's another project that I decided to go back and see if I could improve upon all of those to some degree. And like under an hour, 40 minutes or so. And so I went and did that. And I wanna show you a few of the things, of course that, that I did. So back on my desktop here in, in my website, first of all, I like updated my website also the same way, one of one of those videos. Thank you. One of those videos helped me do some cleanup here, including just talking to cla Claude saying, Hey, I wanna add a bunch of new links up at the top. And it just helped me, get through that in much faster. Let me go through the ones that, that I just mentioned off so that Ignite karaoke. One, I don't know, Ryan, if you remember this tool.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1017" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:57]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I sure do. Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1018" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:16:58]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> But the, this tool lets you play Ignite Karaoke with, whoever your team, your friends, and forever when I first made it up here at the very top, this is supposed to be like a fire flame here. Best you can do in CSS. But there was this huge gap up there and it bugged me and I couldn't figure out how to get rid of it. So I decided to ask Claude code to try to help me. Sort that out. And like within five minutes I had this thing finally like bug free in terms of the things up there that were bothering me. So that was a real quick win that I've been sitting on this for a year, I think, or something like that is the last time I went in here and tried to solve for that. So anyway, it was fun to just go in and I'm stalling here to let all these images go by of course. But it was fun to go through and revisit this project 'cause I feel, and then put it back on my website because I feel like now it is a little bit more complete. I've got some ideas on other things I wanna do but maybe it is, something that some other teams would like to play with.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1077" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:17:57]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, definitely. I think this exercise would really cool. I stumbled a little bit 'cause it's not something I'm used to, but I think it just, I. One that, that, the concept was new to me, but two, being able to have a website where you stand it up really easily to do it where it's already done for you and you can modify from it if you want to. I think it's really cool for other teams to try this experiment and see how it might work for the teams.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1096" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:18:16]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, it was neat. I like to code, but I don't always want to code. Sometimes I just wanna solve a problem, sometimes I'm doing it for I, I enjoy the process but other times I just wanna get to the. The thing that I'm building, like kinda I feel like I'm allow, I am, I'm able to swing in and out of those two modes a lot easier than I Gotcha. Maybe previous had. So I think that's cool. So that's the Ignite Karaoke, the vinyl viewers. Another one that I liked or I was able to figure out a solution to this one. I don't know if I've showed you this before, Ryan, but these are these are all the records that I have in my collection, and you can come in and, click on one. I need to zoom out just a little bit and listen to, I won't play it 'cause it'll just get blocked on YouTube anyway. But you can play, a little snippet of the record. Pick another one. And, and eventually I was gonna have in what this market rates are for each one, because trying to keep track of the value of everything. But anyway, fun little tool here. I use it because I can come in here and, I've got a ton of Frank Zappa of course. And so if I type in Zappa, I can see all the ones that I have. Previously when, you type in Zappa in the search bar, it came up. Everything right? It like filtered all of them correctly. But then if you just, if you clicked on one like Zoo Lus, right? It would show you like some other record. It would just pull up like the, the front art and everything from like a, for different, completely different artists, all that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1177" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:37]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Gotcha.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1177" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:37]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> So it wasn't matching up what was going on. And so I gave the code base, the Claude code, and I explained what's happening and within 20 minutes we had it sorted out.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1189" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:49]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Very cool.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1189" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:19:49]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> And then I went in and made some other little adjustments and improvements to it. So finally got that working, which is really nice. And then the other one that I think actually is turning out really fun or really good as they say. And this one, if you look I, you can still see here. This was the original interface right, that I had, which is fine. It looks like something I would build.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1210" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:10]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1213" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:13]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I, no offense, don't plan, no offense.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1215" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:15]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> It's functional.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1216" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:16]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> It works, it's all I know. Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1218" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:18]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> But there's room for improvement and so that's where we're at now. And so I can come in here and I can put in, I can ask though what's the key word that you're using to make this better?

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1228" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:28]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Make not ugly? What is the thing that helps you get cloud code to make this look better?

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1232" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:32]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> That's a good question. What I did was, obviously I gave it my code base and said I wanna improve, certain things. But I did get specific on here's the colors that I like, I like to use like the Datadog color palette.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1244" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:44]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1245" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:45]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I said I want to use some shadowing and really just gave it some direction on like the CSSI wanna make sure that it works well on mobile.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1251" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:51]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Gotcha.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1252" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:20:52]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> And it was a pretty irr it was more of an iterative process with this one to go back and forth. You can see here anything that doesn't have any animal, that doesn't have a, like a placeholder just automatically shows the Datadog one, which I think I must. Change to, to something else. But but yeah, you can come in here and choose, I'm possibly in the market for adopting a new cat. And we can come in here and take a look at day while these cats are adorable and,

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1276" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:16]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> This is a dangerous application. I kept adopting a cat for sure.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1279" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:21:19]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Originally I was trying to decide if there's some way to use ai. In these images to help them find a home a little bit faster, like all those animals, those pets don't have an image at all. It, they don't really have that good of a chance of finding a home, until there's an image. I put the Datadog one up, but what could we do with AI to find a pet, put something else that like draws people in to at least go look. Oh, that, that animal is at the shelter. That's 10 minutes from me. Just make it a little easier to get these pets adopted. And then I'm obviously building it for myself 'cause I'm, looking for another one too. And this is exactly how I found watermelon. If you've met my current cat watermelon. I built this app last year around this time. And even though it was ugly, it helped me, it led me to her. And so we're going through v two of that process again.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1328" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:08]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> That's really cool.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1328" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:08]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah, so anyway, that that's pretty much it. If you go and check out the site here. I'll pull it up one more time. Oops, wrong one. The other few things down here is just more of the TSS one is more of Yeah, fix, fixing the Ignite Karaoke this is going through and changing and fixing things in with my website. So they're all about 30, 40 minutes. And just like a lot of the stuff we've been doing, just walks you through exactly what we see and what we're experiencing, kinda learning in public.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1359" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:39]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Exactly.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1359" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:39]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> And just sharing that with you. There's very few edits I've cut out, some filler words here and there just to compress the time a little bit. But I've tried to keep it pretty raw and show you exactly what's happening and yeah. Keep doing it that way until we hear otherwise.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1374" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:22:54]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> So that's, that is awesome. I feel like I gotta do the go, do the same. Gotta get off my get off my rocker here and start doing some work.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1382" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:02]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Speaking of the next thing I know you've already been on your horse, on your rock outta your rocker bit, little bit. So what is it you're gonna, maybe share with us like, probably not enough time today, but maybe the next week we can.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1394" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:14]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah, I think so. Last time we talked a little bit about stable diffusion, so I'd like to talk about the future of what that looks like in terms of image generation or at least. To text as we as well. So going the other way flex one or Flex one dev is what I'd like to demo, but I think next week I'll probably talk about Windsurf. I will say I went to the booth at GTC. I have also used it a little bit, but only used it in a way that it would be like I imagining you know, how to use an id. So I was using the way that you'd use Cursor. Winder actually has a whole bunch of features that I've not. Touched at all. I've essentially just used that as in another IDEI think I'd like to talk a little bit about how it works and how it might be a little bit different than cursor. Not better or worse, just a little bit different. I'll try to wear the t-shirt that I got I thought was pretty funny and they also gave me those like the sleep mask kind of thing.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1439" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:59]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Oh yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1439" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:23:59]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> But yeah, I def I've got all the, so it behooves me to talk about their, the topic. But I do feel like at this point in time we've reached a point where there are a couple IDs that are. Popular so you get cursor and windsurf. There's a few more that are becoming in vogue again. So I think Inte is also trying to add similar features to theirs and you can see VS code as well, trying to figure out what that looks like on their end with copilot so I can change copilot to look at it. What I'd like to eventually do is like circle back and look at BS code and maybe Intel j be it Idea or what have you. But at this point in time, I think the next one I'd like to look at is Windsurf and talk about how things are maybe similar but not the same as Cursor, and then go from there.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1478" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:38]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Excellent. Yeah, I've I've been wanting to get my hands on Windsurf and it'll be fun to kinda get your take on it and see what you'll do with it. So looking forward to that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1488" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:48]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> And, lots of things. You just reminded me too. There's even though we've played with Google's suite of tools and Right.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1495" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:55]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Gemini and Gemma and all that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1497" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:24:57]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I need to add some stuff in there because one of the sessions I went to at GTC was a former coworker of mine and she was showing off doing some stuff in a Google notebook, Google collab notebook. With Jim or Gemini. I'm not sure which model she might have been using, but Right. With the interface in there. And that gave me a ton of ideas too. So I, yeah I already had too many toys to go play with and now it's tripled since, got more, yeah.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1522" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:22]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> I also got an email last week while we were at the conference set as part of my Google enterprise. I think I get. Notebook, LM Plus is part of that subscription. So I'd like to kick the tires with that as well at some point. But but yeah, something along those lines, just to make it, it's a little bit more interactive for me, so I don't just have to go into the dashboard and Yeah, because you're right. What feels like a quote unquote ID to us may be different for something like a, somebody, like a data scientist or somebody who's working with more models on a regular basis, Python. Python specific kind of viewpoint might be to start with a notebook and go from there to something else.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1548" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:48]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> That's right. We can open up, Python notebooks, Jupyter Notebooks, some kind of notebook in lots of ways. But the Google collab thing is its own unique thing, right?

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1556" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:25:56]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Yeah. I did a web I did a webinar on it, but that was over a year ago and so much has changed since then. So it's changed a ton.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1564" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:04]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Yeah. Just need to come back and play with it.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1566" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:06]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Absolutely.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1566" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:06]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> I lost chance. Here're data science. They don't they, that is like the, their IDE basically. And it works. Great for lots of other reasons too. I can think of a hundred ways to like do some interesting things in a notebook that, you're just running little snippets of code that absolutely stitch together. It's a really good teaching tool at the very least. Yeah. I find being able to show people stepping through this is what, this is how you install the Datadog integration, here's the next step kind of thing. It's actually pretty handy for that. It's very good for that. So we should re revisit that too.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1594" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:34]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> Definitely. Alright for the sake of time, we should probably wrap this one up and let's do. We will be back again next week with some stuff about windsurf, it sounds and maybe some other things too, depending on time. So looking forward to that.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1607" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:47]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Absolutely. Thank you so much for the recap and your point of view from GTC. 'cause we definitely had two completely different conference experience, aside from listening to records with our friend Bob. But yes, that was a fantastic conference. That's

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1619" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:26:59]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Jason Hand:</span> true. And I will, once I get time, and I mean we're recording this on Monday and we just got home this weekend. As soon as I get time to go through my notes, I will summarize them in some fashion and post them in the show notes of this very cool recording. Very just so that in case anybody's curious about those sessions that I attended, they're really good. That's all I got and we'll see you next time.

<a href="https://youtu.be/IW9GjOzoFAw?t=1638" target="_blank" class="transcript-timestamp">[00:27:18]</a> <span class="transcript-speaker">Ryan MacLean:</span> Alright folks. Have a great week. Bye bye.
