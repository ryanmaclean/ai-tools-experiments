<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=1" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:01]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Happy Monday. It's time to talk about AI stuff again. Indeed. It's like it never ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=7" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:07]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Yeah. And I guess we can do a quick recap of what we've been talking about. I'll go ahead and share my screen. There's a few things I wanna talk about here on the site. The first thing is the last episode that we did is not necessarily this episode.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=22" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:22]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Right? Yeah. Sometimes there's one in progress or one in the queue.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=25" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:25]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Right? So I did just post this on Friday, however you and I got together Thursday, I think it was, and it...</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=32" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:32]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Might even have been Friday. Yeah. Last week was a blur.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=34" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:34]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Maybe it was Thursday, Friday, I can't remember. Yeah. Everything's a blur. Anyway, we got together again and decided to hit record and had a really great conversation. So that's in the pipeline getting processed now. And that's gonna be, I think, episode 16 when we're talking about this one, which is episode 15.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=53" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:53]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Right. We are recording this one a little earlier in the week than maybe we would otherwise. Maybe.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=59" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:59]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> I think maybe we are. So episode 15 is about playing around with Sora, image generation, which is kind of a weird thing to say because Sora is mostly a video platform, right? Or tool?</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=107" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:47]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Mm-hmm. Yeah, I mean, it's it's definitely known for its video capabilities. Yeah.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=111" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:51]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> But it also does images. And this is something that I wanted to talk about because There's a lot of AI generated image content out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=115" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:55]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> We, at GTC, we saw everybody there. Adobe Firefly half a dozen tools that are using like. Avatars, right? So you know, it's here.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=126" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:06]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> I remember that Adobe skateboard video pretty clearly because it was on Candy Valley. There's something weird about the feet pushing the board or something. Anyway I do remember the skateboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=136" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:16]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Yeah, so it, anyway, it's here and some of it's not great and it falls into that category of slop and we all know it when we see it, and we're just kinda we were just, in fact, we were just laughing about some of the stuff that's on the Sora like website. That's just Exactly, because Sora is mostly a video.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=150" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:30]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> However that I think so that, that's what I had heard of anyway. Yeah.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=152" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:32]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> But it does image. Okay. I started off playing around just in the OpenAI ecosystem over the weekend with all of this, because some of the recent models now. Are actually doing quite well when it comes to generating images that contain text. And that is, I think, one area for me that it's not slop necessarily.</p>
