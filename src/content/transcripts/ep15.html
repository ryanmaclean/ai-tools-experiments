            <p>In this episode, Jason Hand and Ryan MacLean explore recent developments in AI tools, focusing on image generation with Sora and app building with Lovable. They begin by discussing Jason's experience using Sora to create images for website thumbnails, noting the significant improvement in AI's ability to generate images with text. Both hosts are impressed by how Sora can now produce professional-looking fonts with proper kerning and layout, a capability that wasn't possible until recently. They examine various images Jason created, including Y2K aesthetic thumbnails and 3D cartoon renderings of cats, acknowledging that generative AI has reached a point where many outputs no longer trigger the 'AI slop' response they previously discussed.</p>

            <p>The conversation then shifts to Lovable, a full-stack development tool similar to Bolt (which they discussed in a previous episode). They explore Lovable's capabilities by building applications - Jason attempts to create a travel notebook app while Ryan builds a weather dashboard. Throughout their hands-on testing, they highlight Lovable's intuitive interface, error correction features, and ability to quickly generate functional applications with minimal input. They discuss limitations of the free tier (which offers only five interactions per day), the GitHub integration options, and how these tools might fit into a developer's workflow. The hosts conclude by reflecting on their evolving perspectives on generative AI tools, with Jason admitting he's warming up to some AI-generated content now that the quality has improved significantly, and both acknowledging Supabase as a valuable database solution that integrates well with these development tools.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=7" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:07]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Yeah. And I guess we can do a quick recap of what we've been talking about. I'll go ahead and share my screen. There's a few things I wanna talk about here on the site. The first thing is the last episode that we did is not necessarily this episode.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=22" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:22]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Right? Yeah. Sometimes there's one in progress or one in the queue.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=25" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:25]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Right? So I did just post this on Friday, however you and I got together Thursday, I think it was, and it...</p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=32" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:32]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Might even have been Friday. Yeah. Last week was a blur.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=34" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:00:34]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Maybe it was Thursday, Friday, I can't remember. Yeah. Everything's a blur. Anyway, we got together again and decided to hit record and had a really great conversation. So that's in the pipeline getting processed now. And that's gonna go up. And yeah, so just just to give you a little idea of what we've been talking about recently is Bolt and that second video is like an extension of that conversation where we go a little bit further.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=60" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:00]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> We'll cover that, I guess maybe, in the next shortly.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=62" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:02]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> Yeah. As soon as I edit the video homework, and I...</p>
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=65" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:05]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Exactly. But if you've been on the site here lately, you may notice that this looks a little different. And that is, we've got these images now, I guess thumbnails you could call 'em, but just these I don't know, imagery to go with the aesthetic of the site here. And I, I... I don't know. I might've gone against the grain here. Unpopular opinion for some people on using Gen AI, but those are all gen AI images that I created using Sora. And I think that the main takeaway for me here is I'm on the big I'm big, like anti AI slop. Same talk about AI slop a lot.</p>

I totally agree with you.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=115" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:01:55]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> We, at GTC, we saw everybody there. Adobe Firefly half a dozen tools that are using like. Avatars, right? So you know, it's here.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=126" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:06]</a> <strong>Ryan MacLean:</strong> I remember that Adobe skateboard video pretty clearly because it was on Candy Valley. There's something weird about the feet pushing the board or something. Anyway I do remember the skateboard.</p>
                    
                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=136" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:16]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> Yeah, so it, anyway, it's here and some of it's not great and it falls into that category of slop and we all know it when we see it, and we're just kinda we were just, in fact, we were just laughing about some of the stuff that's on the Sora like website. That's just Exactly, because Sora is mostly a video.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DcnbH45lfkU?t=152" target="_blank" class="timestamp-link">[00:02:32]</a> <strong>Jason Hand:</strong> But it does image. Okay. I started off playing around just in the OpenAI ecosystem over the weekend with all of this, because some of the recent models now. Are actually doing quite well when it comes to generating images that contain text. And that is, I think, one area for me that it's not slop necessarily.</p>
