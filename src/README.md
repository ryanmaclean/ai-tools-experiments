# Astro Src Directory
This directory contains source files that won't be built into pages by Astro.

Files in this directory are used for:
- Shared components
- Utility functions
- Types and interfaces
- Configuration files
- Other non-page assets

To create pages that will be built by Astro, place them in the `pages` directory instead.

This folder should NOT be removed as it's a core part of Astro's directory structure. Even if empty, keeping it helps maintain the standard project organization.
