# Optimized for hot-reloading and development experience
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install build dependencies for native modules and Python for node-gyp
RUN apk add --no-cache python3 make g++ pixman-dev cairo-dev pango-dev jpeg-dev giflib-dev librsvg-dev

# Set working directory

# Install dependencies first (for better caching)
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --build-from-source

# We don't copy the source here - docker-compose will mount it
# This enables hot reloading without container rebuilds

# Expose the port that Astro dev server runs on
EXPOSE 4321 4322 4323 4324 4325

# Command to run the dev server with host binding for container access
