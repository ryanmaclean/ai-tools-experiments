# Episode Notes: Claude Code

In this two-part episode, Jason Hand explores using Claude Code to build a website with a feedback form for the AI Lab Experiments project. Jason works through the process of converting a GitHub repository into a static website, ultimately hosted on Netlify, with a form that submits feedback data to Datadog as structured logs.
